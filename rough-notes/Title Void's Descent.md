## **Concept:**
## In the Eerie Emptiness of an Abandoned Space Station Orbiting a Desolate Planet, a Young Man Named Jacob Finds Himself Stranded after His Ship Malfunctions. As He Explores the Derelict Station in search of Resources, He Begins to Experience Disturbing Visions and Unexplained Phenomena. Haunting Whispers, Flickering Lights, and Eerie Shadows Hint at a Dark Presence Lurking within the Station.

## Jacob's Sanity is Pushed to the Brink as He Uncovers the Station's Unsettling History - a Failed Experiment in Dimensional Manipulation that Tore Open a Rift between Realities. The Boundary between the Physical World and the Ethereal Realm Becomes Dangerously Blurred, Allowing Malevolent Entities to Cross Over. As the line between Reality and Nightmare Disintegrates, Jacob Must Confront His Own Fears and Unravel the Mystery of the Station's Downfall.
