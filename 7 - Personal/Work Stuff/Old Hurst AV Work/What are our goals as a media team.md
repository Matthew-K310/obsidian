To allow others to be a part of the church, even if they can’t show up

To enhance the quality of the service

To glorify God in what we do

To bring others to Christ 

We need to show up with a good attitude, a heart to serve, and a willingness to listen to authority. 

We can’t work as team if the team doesn’t like each other. 

For the camera ops: don’t be a distraction, keep talking to a minimum, and focus on what needs to be done. If you don’t agree with that, evaluate why you are doing this. 

For switcher: if someone does a good job, thank them and keep going. If they do something wrong, correct them KINDLY, and move on. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I like to be thanked for my work every once in a while.
