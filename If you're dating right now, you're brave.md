# {{Title}}

People often ask themeselves "Why am I even doing this?" whle trying to find/date a long-term partner (poor terminology). 

People feel as if dating is the hardest that it's ever been, with people like it takes too much interpersonal work to support a long-term relationship.

"Modern dating means learning how to be comfortable in with being uncomfortable, standing firmly in your beliefs, and navigating the beliefs of others in very politically divided times..."

"... getting and staying motivated to date even when it feels hard is recognized as an achievement in and of itself."

"Dating People When You Hate People".

Social interactions have suffered since quarantine, with anxiety and depression levels increasing greatly. This has caused regular social interactions to suffer.

This increased social anxiety has made people feel that it is more difficult to
meet new people and put themselves out there in a relationship.
