# Of God and Waiting

"I do not know why
there is this difference,
but I am sure that God keeps no one 
waiting unless He sees
that it is good for him to wait.

When you do enter your room,
you will find that the long wait has done
you some kind of good which
you would not have had otherwise.

But you must regard it as waiting, not
as camping. You must keep on praying 
for light: and of course, even in the hall,
you must begin trying to obey the rules
which are common to the whole house.

And above all you must be asking
which door is the true one;
not which pleases you best by its paint
and paneling."

-- C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*
