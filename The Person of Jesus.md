## Why was it necessary for Jesus to be fully God and fully man?

### The Nature of the Incarnation

$\quad$ "But it is necessary for eternal salvation that one also believe in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully. Now this is the true faith: that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son, is both God and man, equally. He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is man from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely man, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although He is God and man, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by His divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to Himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of His essence, but by the unity of His person. For just as one man is both rational flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and man."

-- Athanasian Creed, lines 29-37

### Fully God

$\quad$ "... and not by His divinity being turned to flesh ..."

$\quad$ Christ never diminished His divinity in any way, but instead perfectly united flesh and Spirit. United, not blended, as "blending" implies a distillation of divinity.

$\quad$ The power of man could never defeat the devil, and someone/something that is not fully divine could never defeat him. Therefore, Christ had to be fully divine in order to defeat the devil (REFINE)

### Fully Man

$\quad$ "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."

$\quad$ Only men can be born under the law, so how could one that is not born of the law fulfill the law? (How can you fulfill a law if you're not in the confines of the law?)

$\quad$"God, in His timing, sent His Son to redeem those under the law, so that we might be adopted as sons." - Personal Bible study notes from Galatians 4:4-5

$\quad$We ourselves, men in the sense of "man" meaning "human", were going to pay the price for our sins in death. (Romans 6:23)

$\quad$ As we could not uphold the law, we could not be saved by the law, and were "dead in our trespasses" (Ephesians 2:4-7); and so we could not atone for our own sins, let alone the sins of humanity as a whole.

$\quad$ But Christ, in HIs perfect unity of flesh and Spirit, lived a perfect, sinless life as a man so that we might have salvation and forgiveness of sins through His death on the cross.

$\quad$"Also, they teach that the Word, that is, the Son of God, did assume a the human nature in the womb of the (blessed) Virgin Mary, so that there are two natures, the divine and the human, inseparably enjoined in one Person, one Christ, true God and true man, who was born of the Virgin Mary, truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, that He might reconcile the Father unto us, and be a sacrifice, (not only for original guilt, but also) for all (actual) sins of man."

-- Augsburg Confession, Article 3, 1-3

He suffered as a man for the sake of all men, that He might reconcile the Father to us, as well as for the forgiveness of sins.

## What does the fact that Jesus took on a fully human nature tell us about what it means to be human?

$\quad$ "For just as one man is both rational soul and flesh, so too the on Christ is both God and man."

$\quad$ Soul and flesh.

$\quad$ Man is made in the image of God, but what does that mean?

$\quad$ I don't believe that God has a physical form/appearance, but He simply IS.

$\quad$ To be made in the image of God is to have both a soul and a mind; the soul to be filled by the Spirit of God, and a mind to be filled with knowledge of God. - (REFINE)

$\quad$ Christ took on the full nature and appearance of man, having soul and flesh.

$\quad$ He was, for all intents and purposes, as we are.

$\quad$ (I need to research this more, as I want a more conclusive answer; I also want to better understand what is the nature of humanity.)
