What happens when smartphones become uncool.

    "We're addicted to media. Smartphones just serve it best right now."

What is the loop?

- "What do we want to build?"
- "How do we implement it?"
- Testing and launch
- Brainstorming
The cycle repeats

Companies try to optimize for your time now, with them trying to get you to spend as much time on the product as possible.

The creator of "The Loop" regrets his creation.

Dumbphone sales have increased and are nearly on par with smartphone sales.

People are trying to detach from the technology that we have to use everyday.

Smoking became uncool, just like smartphones are becoming uncool.

    "Coolness is everything."

Bunt, a German electronic musician, added a rule to his "in-the round" live shows that showcases this move perfectly:

    "Everyone in the inner circle is not allowed to have their phones out."

Bars, concert venues, and even some restaraunts are beginning to restrict the use of smartphones.

"The power of changing culture."
