> The Unfathomable Generosity of God
> 1 Timothy 6:17-19
1, The Giver of Gifts
Trust in God, rather than things.
2, The Extent of His Gifts
God gives according to His ability,
not out of His ability.
God gives exceedingly abundantly,
above.
3. The Purpose of the Gifts
Ecclesiastes 5:19
"Give me neither poverty new riches,
that I might not forgive you."
Luke 12:48
4. The Example of the Gifts
Be generous and ready to share.
Give ungrudgingly, be a cheerful giver.
5. The Premise of Giving
Store up treasures in heaven for the
future, that we may take hold of that
which is life in deed.
I) Yen cannot earn your salvation with
virtuous deeds.
6. The Enemies of Generosity
"These things are written for our benefit"
Be careful of wealth, that you might not
be lead astray.
I) Don't trust in the blessings, trust
the giver of those blessings.
Develop a generous heart.
Be lavish and generous in your giving.
