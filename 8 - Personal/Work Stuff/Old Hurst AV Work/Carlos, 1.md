After much consideration, I have decided to step away from First Hurst Español, effective August 4th. 

 Following our meeting on April 26th, I began to take stock of the situation and my place in FHE’s ministry. I asked close friends and family about the list of requirements you sent over, and we all agreed that it would not be a sustainable position for me to accept. 

 If I were to choose to stay in my position there, it would result in frustration and, eventually, burnout. It’s not viable to continue operating as we do right now with all of the issues due to faulty equipment, not to mention having such a small team of volunteers. 

 Staying until the beginning of August should provide you with enough time to either find a replacement hire, or to have me train someone new. 

 I wish you the best as you continue with First Hurst Español, and I pray that finding a replacements is not too difficult. 

Sincerely,
Matthew Kennedy
