## Doctrinal Standard and General Conduct

- We will hold to these Creeds

  - The Nicene Creed
  - The Athanasian Creed

- These other resources will be optional reading, but will be a good foundation

  - The 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith
  - The Heidelberg Catechism

- Prospective leaders must all read both the required and optional resources
  before becoming leaders
- Leaders must state exceptions to optional resources, and they must fully affirm
  the required doctrinal resources

### Ground Rules

- This is not a time for games, sports, or entertainment; instead, this is a
  time where we come together to focus soley on building each other up and study
  the Word of God faithfully and with maturity

### Doctrinal Disagreements

- We need theological unity in the body
- Exceptions to the creeds will not be tolerated
- Exceptions to confessions and catechisms are almost guaranteed
- Disagreements must not be arguments, but must be based in our mutual love for
  Scripture and the brothers
- Disagreements should not be out of pride, but we should be humble and loving
  in how we rebuke and correct one another
- Worship to come later

- Mainly hymns
  - Mainly acapella
  - Guitar or piano are possible
  - NO DRUMS

## Leadership

- Leadership meetings biweekly to monthly
- State of the group either quarterly or every six months

### Qualities of Leadership

- Above reproach
- Able to assert, rebuke, and correct
- We should have patience in love
- Leaders must agree with the doctrinal statement
- If leaders have a doctrinal disagreement, all leaders discuss it together
-

## The Gospel
