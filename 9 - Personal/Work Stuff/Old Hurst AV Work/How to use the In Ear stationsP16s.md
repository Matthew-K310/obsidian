1. Power on the unit with the small black button on the back
2. Make sure the level and limiter knobs (top right corner) are all the way up
3. All channels are labeled with their respective sources (Vox 1 is lead vocals, Vox 2 is stage right vocals, Vox 4 is stage left vocals)
4. To turn up the volume of a source, first select the channel of the source you want to turn up, then use the knob to the right of the ramp of red lights. The lights indicate the volume of the source, while the knob increases the volume. 
5. If you want to remove bass from a sound, use the knob labeled “lows” or “bass” on the top middle of the panel, and turn it left. 
6. For the high frequencies, repeat with the knob labeled “highs” or “treble”. 
7. Rule of thumb for mixing in ears: keep the volume of yourself at the top of all the others, then keep the keys and drums a bit below that, with the rest way in the back of the mix.
