### The Nature of the Incarnation

$\quad$ "But it is necessary for eternal salvation that one also believe in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully. Now this is the true faith: that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son, is both God and man, equally. He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is man from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely man, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although He is God and man, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by His divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to Himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of His essence, but by the unity of His person. For just as one man is both rational flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and man."

-- Athanasian Creed, lines 29-37

### Fully God

$\quad$ "... and not by His divinity being turned to flesh ..."

$\quad$ Christ never diminished His divinity in any way, but instead perfectly united flesh and Spirit. United, not blended, as "blending" implies a distillation of divinity.

$\quad$ The power of man could never defeat the devil, and someone/something that is not fully divine could never defeat him. Therefore, Christ had to be fully divine in order to defeat the devil (REFINE)

### Fully Man

$\quad$ "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons."

$\quad$ Only men can be born under the law, so how could one that is not born of the law fulfill the law? (How can you fulfill a law if you're not in the confines of the law?)

"God, in His timing, sent His Son to redeem those under the law, so that we might be adopted as sons." - Personal Bible study notes from Galatians 4:4-5

We ourselves, men in the sense of "man" meaning "human", were going to pay the price for our sins in death (Romans 6:23)
