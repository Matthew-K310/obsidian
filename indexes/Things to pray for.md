Hazel's mom has cancer. Pray for healing in this life, and for remission. If that is not God's will, then pray for peace and strength for the family as they deal with this. 

For my accountability group for strength, for courage, for wisdom and guidance, that they would have a heart for the Lord and glorify Him in all that they do
