It's not a type of song.

Is it a type of sound?

Oliver Tree is a good example of this, with a lot of his songs feeling souless and stale. The whole song feels like a chorus, with little to no dynamics.

NPC music has this empty, almost familiar, feeling to it. It's too polished, too sterile, too safe.

It's great as background music. With catchiness coming first, and lyrical depth coming last.

NPC Music:

    "Overly produced pop music that caters to the lowest common denominator in order to maximize reachability and commercial success."

Music as a product.

It's like fake sugar. We have all kinds of artificial sweeteners, but we can't quite match the taste of sugar.

NPC music is like this. They're songs that are trying to be songs, having been engineered to be unoffensive and safe.
