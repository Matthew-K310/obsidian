Item #: SCP-8177

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8177-1 is to be contained at Site 83 in a 12' x 12' x 12' square concrete cell with translocation blockers placed in all surface of the room. 

Every two weeks, SCP-8177-1 is to receive 3-15 Class-D personnel dressed of a particular historic time frame that changes each time. Before sending the Class-D in, consult SCP-8177 as to the historical accuracy of the clothing, so as not to upset the entity and cause a breach. 

Description: SCP-8177-1 appears to be a human male, approximately 60-65 years of age. SCP-8177-1 is roughly 1.78 meters in height, and around 81.5 kilograms in weight. 

Although SCP-8177-1 appears to be a nondescript male, he is functionally immortal and will translocate when under serious threat of death or destruction. 

SCP-8177 appears to have the ability to switch to another host body in a different location entirely. All, as SCP-8177 states, "spare" hosts are of varying ages and sexes, with the majority being male bodies from the ages of 45-74 years old and of an athletic build.
