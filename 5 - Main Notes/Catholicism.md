# Origins, Schisms, and the Reformation

## Origins

The Church of Rome, which would later become the Roman Catholic Church is said to have been founded in AD 30 by Saint Peter on the day of Pentecost. 

St. Clement of Rome, St. Ignatius of Antioch, and St. Irenaeus of Lyons all speak of Saint Peter as being the first bishop of the Catholic Church. 

It is commonly believed that Paul and Peter were both buried in Rome; because of this, many Christians would make pilgrimages to Rome. 

Because of this influx of Christians to Rome, the bishop of Rome became one of the most prominent and influential leader of the western Christian ecclesiastical church.

The Pope and his emissaries were seen as some of the top Christian authorities, and so they were commonly called upon to resolve or weigh in on issues of doctrine or heretical practices. 

The Church of Rome kept meticulous records, and thus was thought to have more standing in the realm of theological issues.

The Pope steadily gained more authority and influence during the collapse of the western Roman Empire; it was because of this that the Church began to fill the institutional power vacuum, with succeeding popes making increasingly ambitious claims to authority. 

## The Great Schism of 1504

The Church of Rome had a Great Schism, which led to it being divided into the western, Latin-speaking Roman Catholic Church and the eastern, Greek-speaking Eastern Orthodox Church. This schism was precipitated by 2 main doctrinal disagreements.

First was the role and authority of the Pope, as well as what the Pope was allowed to have a hand in. 

Second was the question, "From whom does the Holy Spirit proceed?"

The Roman Catholics believed that the Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, while the Eastern Orthodoxy believed that the Spirit proceeds from the Father alone.

The Athanasian Creed (written late 5th century) states as follows concerning the nature of the Spirit:

	"The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten from anyone. The Son was neither made nor created; he was begotten from the Father alone. The Holy Spirit was neither made nor created nor begotten; he proceeds from the Father and Son."

The Holy Spirit proceeds from both the Father and Son, and all 3 are co-equal and co-eternal. The Roman Catholics were correct in their belief. 

## The Reformation

In 1517, a historic event took place which would later cause another schism to occur within the Roman Catholic Church. 

On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, a former Augustinian friar, nailed his Ninety-five Theses to a door in Wittenburg, Germany. Thus began the Reformation movement.

In the theses Luther criticized many aspects of Catholicism, among these were confession; which Luther viewed as being a merely external apology, instead of also being an internal spiritual repentance; and indulgences, which Luther stated as being used as a way to try and sin without consequences. One could commit a sin, buy an indulgence, and the Catholic Church would believe that the sin had no consequence. 

The Church was the split off into the Roman Catholics, the Protestant Reformers (Lutherans, Anglicans, and the Reformed), and the Radical Reformers (Anabaptists).

The Protestants believed that the Bible should be translated for all people to read and understand, while the Roman Catholics maintained that should stay in Latin.
