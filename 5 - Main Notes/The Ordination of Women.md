### Why Should Churches not Ordain Women?

Look at 1 Timothy 2:11-14 - "Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor."

Other verses include 1 Corinthians 14:33-35, Titus 1:5-9

This also covers why women should not exert authority over men in the church.


### What about Prisca?

Aquila and his wife Prisca were a missionary team that worked closely with Paul. 

They initially met Paul in Corinth, and they held a gathering of the church in their home. 

There is a common misconception that Prisca was leading the church out of her home (mainly because Paul named her first, and people read into that too much), but she was not the spiritual leader of her household or of the gathering of the church. That responsibility fell to Aquila. 


### What about Junia?

Romans 16:7 - "Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me."

The common misconception that Junia was one of the apostles comes from the translation "... well known among the apostles..."

There are those who take that to mean that both Andronicus and Junia were apostles, when in reality, the translation merely is speaking of the fact that the apostles know of them and their faith. They were known to be good kinsmen and they were in the faith long before Paul. 

### What about Mary Madelene?

Matthew 28:9-10 - "And behold, Jesus met them and said, 'Greetings!' And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, 'Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.'"

Jesus tells Mary Magdelene and the other Mary to go and tell His brothers (the disciples) to go to Galilee, that they might see the risen Christ.

The argument here is that Mary Magdelene had exerted authority over the disciples as she told them about the resurrection, and therefore the Bible supports women as teachers over men. 

If sharing the news is what made these women apostles, shouldn't all those who gossip be apostles as well?
