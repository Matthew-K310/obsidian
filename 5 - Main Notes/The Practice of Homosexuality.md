### What Does the Old Testament Say?

In the Old Testament law, the Lord calls the act of a man lying with a man as with a woman an abomination (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13).

There are those who would argue that we are no longer under the Old Testament law, and hence these verses do not apply today.

This is a false view, but let's entertain it for a moment.

If we are no longer under the Old Testament law and covenant, then the Ten Commandments do not apply anymore. We can kill, steal, lie, adulterate, and worship idols as much as we want because the law doesn't cover it. 


### What Does the New Testament Say?

There are still many passages in the New Testament (Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, 1 Timothy 1:8-11) that speak against the practice of homosexuality. 

No matter whether you look at the Old Testament or the New Testament, God is very clear; homosexuality, the act of a man having sex with another man, or a woman having sex with another woman, is a sinful and abominable act that is contrary to nature, as well as God's intent for sexual relations.
