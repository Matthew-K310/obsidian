Dissatisfaction and conflict are in abundance in this modern day, with it being harder to find good, wholesome, and satisfying relationships.

"Why is society changing in this way? Why are the stories and guidance around relationships becoming more confusing the process too? What can we do about it?"

## Culture, Social Scripts, and Relationships

Script theory is the idea that we use mental narratives, almost like we're a character in a movie, to understand and structure the world around us. The content is usually structured in three general layers:

Cultural scenarios: Societal and social instructions and normalities that shape roles and customs  

Interpersonal scripts: Individual behaviors, ideas, and biases that help our interactions with others by sparking conversations about difference of opinion.

Intrapsychic scripts: Private wishes and desires.

Each person's narrative is a combination of these three, with the goal being to bring order and meaning to life while staying in line with cultural norms and fostering direct relationships. 

Within romantic relationships, these narratives would include gender roles, personal stories, and helping one another to understand the other person better.

These scripts are all to help us make sense of a life where anything can happen, and essentially are our attempts to bring order to chaos.

## Changes to the Social Script

Cultural changes have led to changes to our scenarios and scripts that we've built up over time, leaving us to try and cope with the changes and modifications to follow.

Paradigmatic societies focus on cultural scenarios, and provide a more limited list of roles and scenarios for individuals. This leads to a higher degree of shared understanding between individuals of different walks of life. Inside of relationships, this would include things like courtship rituals, dating stages (talking stage???), and gender roles. "Nevertheless, such a limited set of norms and roles can constrain personal choices and preferences as well." 

Post-paradigmatic societies focus on intrapsychic and individual scripts. This is more of a modern view of society, with a lot of societal norms and roles being overturned (for the sake of "progress"). In these societies, people are more individual, and less restricted by relationships norms that have been around for decades, with people being free to explore their preferences and desires. These more numerous options come at a cost, with that cost being a greater lack of certainty and more work.

## Coping with modern social changes

As societies modernize we see the trade-offs between structure and choices (see above). Even with the benefits, we tend to see a loss of meaning and connecton in modern (post-paradigmatic) societies. As a result, we have to options:

Reestablish cultural scenarios, where we can revert to traditional social norm and roles to regain meaning, understanding, and connection with others.

Take responsibility to create personal fulfillment, with individuals creating their own meaning (their truth?) and roles with others who share the same modern view.
