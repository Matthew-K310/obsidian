## Discussion Questions

- What is the purpose of the Church?
- Many people hold on to the fact that you don't have to go to church to be a
  Christian. What do you think of this?
- Even though going to church is not what makes you a Christian, why is being an
  active part of the Church crucial to the life of a Christian?
- Which members of the body of Christ are you tempted to consider as more
  important than others?
- In what ways do you personally need the Church? In what ways does the Church
  need you?
- Is there a group at school (sports team, friend group, etc.) in which your
  sense of belonging is stronger than your sense of belonging to God's people, the
  Church?
- In what ways are you tempted to prioritize yourself over your brothers and
  sisters in Christ?
- Why should our strongest sense of belonging be to the Church? How should this
  affect the way we order our lives? (meaning, how should this affect our
  priorities?)
