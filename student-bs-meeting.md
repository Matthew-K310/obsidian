## Youth Men's Bible Study

---

### The Goal

The main goal with this is to grow in our understanding of God by reading and
discussing alongside our brothers in the faith.

This will be a time almost solely devoted to studying and discussing the word of
God in a round-table style setting.

---

While I and many others love Equip (and have learned a lot through it), we feel
that there just isn't enough time to really drill down into the word due to
tighter schedule of it all.

---

## Doctrinal Standards

---

First and foremost, we shall use the Bible as the root of our doctrinal
statement. There is no better resource than the divine Word of God itself.

---

Second, we'll use the Nicene Creed to ensure that all have a clear
understanding of the truth of the gospel.

---

Third, we'll use the Athanasian Creed predominately for its very clear and
descriptive explanation of the triune and divine nature of God and of the
sacrifice of Christ on the cross.

---

Fourth and finally, we will use the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith to
help train our leaders in basic Baptist doctrinal truths, as well as for a crash
course in church history.

---

## Leadership

---

### Who Will Lead?

Leadership will be a volunteer position only. If we just chose people all
willy-nilly, we risk having leaders who are not fully committed and end up
hindering rather that helping.

---

### Responsibilities

<!-- First; it is your job to guide the conversation and keep it on-topic and not -->
<!-- just full of random conversations and joking. Jokes are fine, but don't let them -->
<!-- derail the entire study. -->
<!---->
<!-- Second; you are in charge of collecting the notes, prayer requests, and -->
<!-- whatever else may come up from your group (i.e. reporting something that was -->
<!-- shared in accountability) -->

---

We would prefer that those who lead be juniors and seniors in high school, with
sophomores being added as voted on by upperclassman. This way we can ensure at
least some semblance of maturity within the leadership structure.

---

For leadership attributes, we will hold to the teaching of Paul in 1 Timothy
3:1-13 and 4:6-16, where Paul lists out the qualifications and instructions for
those who are in a position of spiritual leadership.

---

## Required Reading

- The Nicene Creed

- The Athanasian Creed

- The 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith

---

We also hope to read the next article of the Heidelberg Catechism before we
split into small groups each week.

The reasoning behind having these resources is twofold:

First; so that we can ensure that all who wish to lead have a firm foundation
in the truth of the gospel.

Second: so that we can make sure that they know what they are getting into.
This is not a position to be taken lightly, as you will be guiding the
discussion; that is to say, not teaching a lesson, but rather making sure that
the conversation stays on track and is at least related to the passage.
