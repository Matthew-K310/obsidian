"Essentially, this theory claimed that Adam and Eve sold humanity over to the Devil at the time of the Fall' hence, justice required that God pay the Devil a ransom, for the Devil did not realize that Christ could not be held in the bonds of death. Once the Devil accepted Christ's death as a ransom, this theory concluded, justice was satisfied and God was able to free us from Satan's grip." - Robin Collins, "Understanding Atonement: A New and Orthodox Theory."

### What Does it Teach?

The basic concept is that Adam and Eve sold humanity over to the Devil when they committed the first sin. Following that, Satan demanded a ransom payment from God, and that way we could be set free. 

Satan demanded that the ransom be Jesus Christ, and so God gave his Son as a ransom payment for our sins, that we might be set free by Him and return to Him.

The Devil accepted the ransom, not realizing that death could not hold Jesus; and so Jesus escaped the grasp of the Devil and justice was satisfied. 

Now that the Devil's demands were satisfied, God then freed us from the grasp of the Devil. 

### Where Did it Originate?

According to Stephen D. Morrison's article "[7 Theories of the Atonement Summarized](https://www.sdmorrison.org/7-theories-of-the-atonement-summarized/)", the ransom theory has roots in the Early Church, mainly from Origen in the 3rd century. 

### Who Taught It?

- Origen believed that Satan old all people and demanded that the God the Father give him Jesus the Son. Satan released humanity, but found Christ too powerful to keep imprisoned. 

- Irenaeus came before Origen (Irenaeus died in 200, with Origen's death coming 254), and based his theory on his (mis)interpretation of Matthew 12:29.
	
	"Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house."

	Irenaeus believed that, by submitting to death on the cross, Jesus tied up the "strong man" - in this case, Satan; and thus carried off the "plunder" - God's chosen. 

- Gregory of Nyssa agreed with Origen, but thought of Jesus' humanity as the "bait" that hid his deity from the Devil. 

- John of Damascus adapted Gregory's metaphor but insisted that Jesus could never be under Satan's power, and instead believed that the debt was paid to death instead of Satan.

There were many who founded this theory on a misinterpretation or a dramatization of the Scripture's message of redemption through Christ's substitutionary atonement on the cross.

### Who Believes It?

Apart from those who founded this theory, are there others who still conform to this belief?

The ransom theory is associated with the Eastern Orthodox Church.

It is not widely accepted in modern day Christianity, but some Anabaptist peace churches and some from the Word of Faith (prosperity gospel) movement still endorse it.

### What's Are Its Issues?

The Bible teaches that Christ gave Himself up on the cross as the propitiation (appeasement or amending) for our sins. 

He took the full force of God's wrath upon Himself and turned it away from His people (those who believe on His name as told by John 1:12).

He suffered in our place; and through His death, Christ destroyed the power of the Devil. 

The ransom theory is contrary to this foundational truth of salvation in many ways. While it still teaches that Christ died for our sins and opened the way to salvation, it takes a very different (and predominately unbiblical) view on certain things. 

- Firstly; this theory attributes too much power to the Devil.

	The idea that Satan made demands and God complied with them is contrary to the truth that Satan only has power the he has because God allows it. 

	Job 1:6-12 and 2:1-6 tell of Satan going to God and being instructed as to how he could punish Job. 

	Job 1 shows that God allowed the Devil to stretch out his hand against all that Job had, but he was not allowed to harm Job directly. 

	Job 2 tells of how Satan doubted that Job's faith would withstand physical hardships such as disease. God allowed Satan to touch his flesh and bones, but he was not permitted to kill Job. 

Here we see that, although Satan has power, he is still under the rule and authority of God Almighty. 

- Second; we never owed a debt to Satan. 

	Ligonier Ministries article "[The Ransom Theory](https://learn.ligonier.org/devotionals/ransom-theory)" has many good statements on this. 

	"Scripture never describes us as owning Satan anything."

	"If we accept the ransom-to-Satan view, we neglect that we are debtors to God."

	Our debt is not owed to the Devil; instead, it is owed to the Lord God Almighty against whom we sinned and rebelled against.

	"This enslavement is a consequence of the debt sinners have incurred against God."

- Third and finally; it implies that the Lord deceived Satan.

	"â€¦ the Devil did not realize that Christ could not be held in the bonds of death."

	One of the main beliefs of the ransom theory is that Jesus "baited" the Devil by hiding His deity behind His humanity.

	If Jesus had baited the Devil into thinking He held no power over death, He would then be guilty of lying and deception.

	This would contradict what the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21. 

	"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

Jesus Christ lived a perfect life, free of all sin, and so He was the spotless lamb sacrificed for our sins. With His sacrifice, He took on the sin and punishment of all those who were chosen for salvation that we would be given the gift of salvation and external life with Him.

Ligonier said it best in their Coram Deo:

"Christ has paid this debt for all who love Him, and has set us free from the dominion of Satan and his minions. Nothing more needs to be done, and we can rest knowing that we are at peace with God and no longer in debt to Him for violating His law."
