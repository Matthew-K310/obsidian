    “Our right standing with God is based on an alien righteousness. It means we are justified because of a righteousness that is not our own. I am not right with God because of my righteousness, but because ‘the perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ’ has been credited to me. We contribute nothing to our salvation.”
