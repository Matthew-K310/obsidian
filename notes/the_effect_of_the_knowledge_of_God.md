“The effect of our knowledge rather ought to be, *first*, to teach us reverence and fear; and, *secondly*, to induce us, under its guidance and teaching, to ask every good thing from him, and, when it is received, ascribe it to him.”

— John Calvin, “Institutes of the Christian Religion”, Book First, Chapter 2
