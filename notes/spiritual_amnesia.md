In our eagerness to sin and disobey God, we forget that the Son paid the ultimate sacrifice through His death on a criminal's cross, that we might have a way to eternal life with the Father in heaven.

Do we truly realize what we're doing when we sin? I don't believe so because, if we did, I don't think we'd be so apt to sin.

When we sin, we are basically saying to God, "I know you died for me and my sins, but I'm just gonna walk all over that and do my own thing regardless."

Do we truly not understand the gravity of that?

God sent His only Son, who was begotten from the essence of the Father and is co-equal with Him, to pay the price for our sins. He came down to earth wrapped in humanity, no less God than before; lived a sinless life; and then was wrongfully accused, tried, and subsequently convicted to a humiliating death on a criminal's cross.

How could we possibly even think of downplaying what He did to save us?
