There was a man named Noah who built an ark. People will well say what did Noah do? Well, he built an ark. But very few people know the conversation that went on between the Lord and Noah. So Noah was in his rec room showing away. Making a few things for the home. He was a good carpenter.

  

I was thinking, what would be the effect of an ark on the average neighbor? Now here is a guy going to work at 7 o’clock in the morning. Noah’s next-door neighbor sees the ark.

  

Of course, Noah had a heck of a job, really. He had to go out into the world collecting all the animals in the world by twos. Two mosquitoes, male or female? And he kept telling the rabbits “only two, only two, ONLY TWO”. We find Noah pulling up the last two animals, two hippos, and Noah is really in a hurry because he is afraid that the Lord is going to call him to do something else. And his nerves are shot. This is one heck of a job for a man 600 years old. So we find him pulling up the last two hippos, and the Lord, of course, does call him.
