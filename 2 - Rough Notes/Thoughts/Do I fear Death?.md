# Do I fear Death?

I think I'm more fear the uncertain nature of my death, as well as the actions leading up to it, more than I fear the deed and finality of death itself. 

Despite my apprehension, I know where I'll end up. 

My hope is in God Almighty, and I know where I'm going when I die, so I have nothing to fear.
