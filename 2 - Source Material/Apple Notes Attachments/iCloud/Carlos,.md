After much consideration, I have decided to step away from First Hurst Espanol, effective August 25th. 

 Following our meeting on April 26th, I began to take stock of the situation and my place in FHE’s ministry. I asked close friends and family about the list of requirements you sent over, and we all agreed; it would not be a sustainable position for me to accept. 

 If I had chosen to stay in my position there, it would result in frustration and, eventually, burnout. Its not viable to continue operating as we do right now with all of the issues due to faulty equipment, not to mention having such a small team of volunteers. 

 I figured staying until the end of August would provide you with enough time to either find a replacement hire, or to have me train someone new. (I would highly recommend against having Jafet be that replacement for a few reasons: 

 First, he rarely shows up for rehearsals. Having your media team be there for rehearsal is required if things are to operate in a smooth and professional manner. What does not need to happen is having the team show up half an hour before rehearsal, but they should be there at least 15 minutes before hand to make sure things are set up. 

Second, he’s not willing to learn. I have tried many time since I started back in April 2023 to teach him all that I know, but he has barely retained a lot of that teaching. Its hard to teach someone who doesn’t want to be taught.)

 I wish all of you the best as you decide the future of First Hurst Espanol, and I pray that finding a replacement is not too difficult. 

Signed, 
Matthew Kennedy
