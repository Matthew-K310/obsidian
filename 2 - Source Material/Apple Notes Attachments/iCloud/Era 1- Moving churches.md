Era 2- Making friends

Era 3- Camp

1. Rise

It’s June 28th, 2021. I’ve been in a van for the past nine hours. We’ve been driving, almost nonstop, to Bear Trap Ranch in Colorado Springs in tight quarters. It’s me and 13 other guys talking, laughing, and listening to music in a van. We get to the base of the mountain and I put on “Rise” by Lost Frequencies. 

It seemed appropriate at the time because I was rising above the clouds and above temptations. I’ve never been more excited, nervous, and freaked out in my life. We finish the drive up, and I set foot on the gravel and breathe fresh mountain air for the first time. I get to the tent and start the orientation process, ready to get closer to God and my friends. 

1. Love to go
2. I miss the future

Basement under the auditorium

Strange graffiti on the walls
Creepy blue lights in a hallway
Cold air 
Sounds of friends laughing and joking around
Heart racing 
Strange smells 
The book of accents and the butter knife on the table

Neal Hollingsworth is the best teacher I’ve ever had. He’s told us that we can explore the basements under Austin College in our free time. We decided to start with the auditorium and have made it to the stairs, all excited and nervous because we don’t know if we are supposed to be down here. We start going down the stairs laughing and joking around about what might be down here. 

We make it to the bottom of the stairs and are starting to get a little scared. In front of us is a door with a small window, revealing a horror movie-vibe inducing blue lit hallway with graffiti and plywood lining the walls. We vote for who goes first and, one by one, we go through the door into the main basement. Inside is the strangest room I’ve ever seen: it has a warehouse vibe.
