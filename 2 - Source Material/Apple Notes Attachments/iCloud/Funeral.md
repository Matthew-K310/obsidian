I’m sorry to bother you today. Below are various texts that have come from Jeff today about the funeral. I thought I better send them to you for the music and AV part

### In preparation for Mary’s service:
1. There will be a slideshow. It should be shown beginning @ 10:00 during the visitation and again after the service as the family is escorted to the foyer. The family knows it needs to be to church on Monday.

2. When the church opens @ 8:30 will be fine for pre-service prep.

3. No extra tables nor an easel are needed.

4. No pianist is needed.

5. Aaron Snow (grandson-in-law) will be doing the music. He and his son will need to do mic check and rehearse. 
They will need mics for vocals (2) and 2 channels for the guitars (one with active pickups and one with passive pickups). Can that be ready for them @ 9:30, giving them 30 minutes to prepare prior to the visitation?

6. I forgot to ask about streaming but I will. If they want it, I’m sure it will be one camera only.

7. No one else is speaking besides me so we won’t need a mic @ the pulpit.

8. At 10:55 when the casket is closed the slideshow should be stopped and instrumental (old hymns) should be played.

9. Seating should be reserved for 50.

10. Bluebonnet will be coordinating the service.

### What am I forgetting?
Also, we’ll need lyrics for songs; exactly what is still a work in progress. I should have details later today.
