I have seen a whole bunch of red flags today; you forget that we’re going to talk because you were with a guy, you say that you wanted talk, not because I deserve answers after all we have been through, but because your worried what it was going to look like when we eventually saw each other again. Oh, and the fact that after explaining everything that happened and why you dumped me. 

I can live with the fact that you’re dealing with a lot, and a relationship isn’t the best thing for you but what I can’t stand is the fact that you are already talking to another guy. All of that being said I wish you the best in life. 

I hope you figure out what you need to and that it works out for the both of you. I do still care for you Grace, but don’t for a second take me for a fool.
