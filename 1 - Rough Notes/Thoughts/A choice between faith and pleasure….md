It’s a choice between my faith and my desires.

Every day I have to make a choice. Look at porn, don’t look at porn. Read my Bible, or procrastinate and not read it.

Today is different.

It’s the choice between reading my Bible, or masturbating to pictures of women.

It shouldn’t be a difficult choice, but I got myself into the habit of prioritizing my desires and pleasure over anything else.

It’s fucking with my head, and it’s messing up my creativity and logical thinking.

I need to quit.

Next month will be a change.

I will win.
