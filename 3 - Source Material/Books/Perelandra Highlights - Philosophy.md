**$\quad$** "He had meant to extract the smallest, experimental sip, but the first taste, but the first taste put his caution all to flight. It was, of course, a taste, just as his thirst and hunger had been thirst and hunger. But then it was so different from every other taste that it seemed mre pedantry to call it a taste at all. It was like the discovery of a totally new genus of pleasures, something unheard among men, out of all reckoning, beyond all covenant. <ins>For one draught of this on Earth wars would be fought and nations betrayed.</ins>" - Page 46

**$\quad$**"And yet to repeat a pleasure so intense and almost so spiritual seemed an obvious thing to do. His reason, or what we commonly take to be reason in our own world, was all in favor of tasting this miracle again; the child-like innocence of fruit, the labours he had undergone, the uncertainty of the future, all seemed to commend the action. yet something seemed opposed to this 'reason.' It is difficult to suppose that this opposition came from desire, for what desire would turn from so much deliciousness? But for whatever cause, it appeared to him better not to taste again. Perhaps the experience had been so complete that repetition would be a vulgarity-like asking to hear the same symphony twice in a day. 
**$\quad$** As he stood pondering over this and wondering how often in his life on earth he had reiterated pleasures not through desire, but in the teeth of desire and in obedience to a spurious rationalism..." - Pages 46 & 47

**$\quad$** "... he saw reality, and thought it was a dream." - Page 49

**$\quad$** "To be the figure that he was in this unearthly pattern appeared sufficient." - Page 52

$\quad$ "... he thought how easy it would be to get up and plunge oneself through the whole lot of them and to feel, all at once, that magical refreshment multiplied tenfold. But he was restrained by the same sort of feeling which had restrained him over-night from tasting a second gourd. He had always disliked the people who encored a favorite air in an opera-'That just spoils it' had been his comment. But this now appeared to him as a principle of far wider application and deeper moment. This itch to have things over again, as if life were a film that could be unrolled twice or even made to work backwards... was it possibly the root of all evil? No: of course the love of money was called that. But money itself-perhaps one valued it chiefly as a defense against chance, a security for being able to have things over again, a means of arresting the unrolling of the film." - Pages 53 & 54

**$\quad$** "'You say you were young?'
**$\quad$** 'Yes.'
**$\quad$** 'Are you not young to-day also?'
**$\quad$** She appeared to be thinking for a few moments, so intently that the flowers dropped, unregarded, from her hand.
**$\quad$** 'I see it now,' she said presently. 'It is very strange to say one is young at the moment one is speaking. But to-morrow I shall be older. And then I shall say I was young to-day. You are quite right. This is great wisdom you are bringing, O Piebald Man.'
**$\quad$** 'But you are very little older than yesterday.'
**$\quad$** 'How do you know that?'
**$\quad$** 'I mean,' said Ransom, 'a night is not a very long time.'" - Pages 68 & 69

$\quad$ "'And after this,' said Ransom, 'it will all be men.'"
$\quad$ 'You say it as if you were sorry.'
