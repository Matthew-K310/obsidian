#### #3 *Christus Victor*

Classically, the Christus Victor theory of Atonement is widely considered to be the dominant theory for most of the historical Christian Church. In this theory, Jesus Christ dies in order to defeat the powers of evil (such as sin, death, and the devil) in order to free mankind from their bondage. This is related to the Ransom view with the difference being that there is no payment to the devil or to God. Within the *Christus Victor* framework, the cross did not pay off anyone but defeated evil thereby setting the human race free.

Gustaf Aulen argued that this theory of the Atonement is the most consistently held theory for church history, especially in the early church up until the 12th century before Anslem’s satisfaction theory came along. He writes that “the work of Christ is first and foremost a victory over the powers which hold mankind in bondage: sin, death, and the devil.”\[ref\] *Christus Victor* P. 20\[/ref\] He calls this theory the “classic” theory of the Atonement. While some will say that *Christus Victor* is compatible with other theories of the Atonement, others argue that it is not. Though I have found that most theologians believe that *Christus Victor* is true, even if it is not for them the primary theory of Christ’s death.
