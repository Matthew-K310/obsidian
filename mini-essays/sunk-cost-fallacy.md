# {{Title}}

The sunk cost fallacy is the idea that, "I've spent a lot on money of this, so I have to spend more money on it to try and make it work."

Replace money with time, effort, whatever it may be.

A personal example of this was my inital website concept. I had spent a lot of time and effort on it, and then wasted more and more time and effort continuing on and trying to make it work.

Instead of sinking more and more time and effort, take a step back.

	- Adam Savage

Don't be afraid to start from scratch.

It will always be better the second time.
