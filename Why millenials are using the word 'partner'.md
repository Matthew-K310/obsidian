# {{Title}}

When Gavin Newsom was sworn in as governor of California early January 2019, his wife, Jennifer, decided to forgo usng the title of "first lady". Instead, she opted to be referred to as the "first partner".

She posted this explanation on Twitter:

    "Being First Partner is about inclusion, breaking down stereotypes, and valuing the partnerships that allow any of us to succeed.

    Grateful for this opportunity to continue advocating for a more equitable future - now let's get to work!"

All over the country, people are swapping traditional relationship terms like "girlfriend" or "husband" with the word "partner".

The word "partner" has an interesting history. It was originally used to describe a business relationship, it was slowly adopted by gays in the mid to late 80s.

    "As the AIDS epidemic rattled the country, he (Michael Bronski) added, it became critical for gay people to signal the seriousness of their romantic relationships, both to health-care professionals to gain access at hospitals and, eventually to their employers, once companies began to extend health-care benefits to domestic partners."

Recently, straight couples have been increasingly been using the word partner to describe thier relationships.

    "On certain college campuses, several students said, it would come across as strange, even rude, to use the terms 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend' in lieu of the more inclusive, gender-neutral 'partner'."

-- It's being used more out of "politeness" (pandering) to the gay community more than anything else. --

    "'Boyfriend' and 'girlfriend' are too high school. 'Significant other' sounds as if it belongs on a legal document. 'Lover' connotes too much sex for everyday use; 'companion' not enough."

People see the word "partner" as being the perfect signifier of the equality and seriousness of the relationship.

    "For a long time, a wedding was the only way to signal the depth and seriousness of a romantic relationship, said Amy Shackelford, founder and chief executive of the feminist wedding planning company Modern Rebel. “But we work with couples who get married six years, nine years, 12 years, after they started dating,” she told me. “You think they weren’t serious before then?” The word “partner,” she said, gives couples the power to publicly announce a lasting adult commitment, without an engagement or a wedding. If the couple does decide to get married, the ceremony itself serves not to solidify the relationship but to celebrate it, surrounded by family and friends."
