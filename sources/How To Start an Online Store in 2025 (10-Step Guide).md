The branding of [Verve’s](https://www.vervecoffee.com/) online store is consistent with its packaging and marketing content, increasing overall brand recognition.

To give your store a consistent and professional feel, you’ll need to consider [branding](https://www.shopify.com/blog/what-is-branding). It’s not just about a logo or a color scheme; branding is about creating [an identity](https://www.shopify.com/blog/brand-identity) that resonates through your images and content.

Create the following brand assets to use throughout your online store:

#### Brand values and mission

Decide what your brand stands for—its purpose, your [unique selling proposition](https://www.shopify.com/blog/unique-selling-proposition), and your promise to customers. These [brand values](https://www.shopify.com/blog/brand-values) will influence the [look and feel](https://www.shopify.com/blog/branding-design) of your store, informing design and color choices as well as the tone of your [brand voice](https://www.shopify.com/blog/brand-voice).

#### Store name

Whether you use your own name, an [evocative term](https://www.shopify.com/blog/4660242-what-should-i-name-my-online-store), or a literal description of what you sell, your store name is often the first touchpoint a customer has with your brand. If you need inspiration, try this [free domain name generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/domain-name-generator) to produce on-brand suggestions and see which name ideas are available as domain addresses.

#### Logo

A logo is a [visual shorthand for your brand](https://www.shopify.com/blog/how-to-design-logo) that lives across a wide variety of surfaces, from your store to the shelves of other retailers.

#### Lifestyle and product photos

Photos help illustrate the features and quality of your products, but can also help customers see how your product might complement their lifestyle. Use [lifestyle photos](https://www.shopify.com/blog/lifestyle-photography) to tell an aspirational story.

It’s easy to take product photos with a [smartphone camera](https://www.shopify.com/blog/15163633-how-to-capture-high-quality-product-photos-with-your-smartphone).
