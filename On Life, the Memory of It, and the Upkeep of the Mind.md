# C.S. Lewis on the Context of Memories


> [!tldr] TLDR
> We think of pleasure and memory as two separate things, but they are to be one thing. 
> Life should not be lived by longing for that which has already passed; but instead, we should remember fondly that which has happened and let that be a happy guide throughout the rest of our lives.
> A memory is only pleasurable in the context of that which came before it, and that which comes after it.

### Content only to Remember?

	'Hyoi, if you had more and more young, would Maledil broaden the handramit and make enough palnts for them all?'
	'The séroni know that sort of thing. But why should we have more young?'
	Ransom found this difficult. At last he said:
	'Is the begetting of young not a pleasure among the hrossa?'
	'A very great one, Hmān. This is what we call love.'
	'If a thing is a pleasure, a hmān wants it again. He might want the pleasure more often than the number of young that could be fed.'
	It took Hyoi a long time to get the point.
	'You mean,' he said slowly, 'that he might do it not only in one or two years of his life but again?'
	'Yes.'
	'But why? Would he want his dinner all day or want to sleep after he had slept? I do not understand.'
	'But a dinner comes every day. This love, you say, comes only once while the hross lives?'
	But it takes his whole life. When he is young he has to look for his mate; and then he has to court her; then he begets young; then he rears them; then he remembers all this, and boils it inside him and makes it into poems and wisdom.'
	'But the pleasure he must be content only to remember?'
	'That is like saying "My food I must be content only to eat."
	'I do not understand.'

Here, we see Ransom (a human) speaking to Hyoi (a hross from Malacandra, or Mars) about the nature of the hrossa and séroni (the intelligentsia of Malacandra). 

Ransom originally asked if there were wars between the hrossa and séroni, to which Hyoi replied in the negative sense. Then Ransom asked if they would fight over food, to which Hyoi said, 'If the other hnau (sentient beings) wanted food, why should we not give it to them? We often do.'

Hyoi stated that Maledil would always provide enough food, to which Ransom replied with the question in the opening quote above. 

Ransom is puzzled as to why the hrossa only breed once or twice in their lifetime, and wonders as to whether or not the experience is indeed pleasurable to the hrossa. Hyoi replies in the affirmative, which puzzles Ransom even more. Why would the hrossa restrict the feeling of pleasure that comes from love and the begetting of children to only happen once or twice in their lives? 


### The Context of Life and Later Pleasures

	"But the pleasure he must be content only to remember?"
	"That is like saying 'My food I must be content only to eat.'"
	"I do not understand."
	"A pleasure is full grown only when it is remembered. You are speaking, Hmān, as if the pleasure were one thing and the memory another. It is all one thing. The séroni could say it better than I say it now. Not better than I could say it in a poem. What you call remembering is the last part of the pleasure, as the crah is the last part of a poem. When you and I met, the meeting was over very shortly, it was nothing. Now it is growing something as we remember it. But still we know very little about it. What is will be when I remember it as I lie down to die, what it makes in me all my days till then-that is the real meeting. The other is only the beginning of it. You say you have poets in your world. Do they not teach you this?"
	"Perhaps some of them do," said Ransom. "But even in a poem does a hross never long to hear one splendid line over again?"
	"And indeed," he (Hyoi) continued, "the poem is a good example. For the most splendid line becomes fully splendid only by means of all the lines after it; if you went back to it you would find it less splendid than you thought. You would kill it. I mean in a good poem."
	"But in a bent poem, Hyoi?"
	"A bent poem is not listened to, Hmān."

Are we to be content only with the memory of pleasure?

Are we to only be content only to eat our food?

What makes a time good? 

Is it the time as you are living it? The things that happen in the moment that make you want to stay in it?

Or is it later the memory of such a moment that brings joy?

Hyoi states that pleasure and memory are one with each other. You may meet someone, and it just be a simple meeting. You may kiss someone, but not fully realize the effect it has on you. 

What makes these moments, these simple parts of life so pleasurable, is the later memory of that which happened. This is why nostalgia is such a common feeling; there was a moment that happened previously in our life that we didn't fully appreciate at the time, and we look back on it fondly. We may feel like we want to relive it; we may long for it so much so that we miss the present pleasures. 

"For the most splendid line becomes fully splendid only by means of all the lines after it; and if you went back to it you would find it less splendid than you thought."

Maybe those moments weren't as amazing at the time of happening as they are now that you are remembering them. 

Maybe, just maybe, the longing is what makes the memory of that time all the sweeter.
