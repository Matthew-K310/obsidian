"No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard
to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do
not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie.
Only those who try to resist temptation know how
strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the
German army by fighting against it, not by giving in.
You find out the strength of the wind by trying to walk
against it, not by lying down. A man who gives in to
temptation after five minutes simply does not know
what it would have been like an hour later. That is why
bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness.
They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in."
