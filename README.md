# Obsidian

This is my Git backup of my Obsidian vault.

I hope to set up a nextcloud or similar server to self host backups at some point.

## --UPDATE--

As of January 10th, 2025, I have a working Nextcloud server that receives regular vault backups via the Remotely Sync plugin in Obsidian.

As of April 22nd, 2025, server is bye bye for right now.
