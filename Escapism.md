# {{Title}}

I want escape. 

From what?

From my fear

From my anxiety 

From my anger

From myself

Where do I turn to to find that escape?

Porn?

Social media?

Masturbation?

Why do I do this to myself?

Why do I both crave isolation

and want interaction?

Why is my mind a battlefield

instead of a temple for the Lord?

Why do I not turn to Him

instead of these temporary “pleasures”?

Because I’m prideful

Because I think I know better 

But I know nothing

compared to Him who created me. :w
