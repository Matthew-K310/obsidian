## What is a Covenant?

    "Generally speaking, a covenant is a promise between two or more parties to perform certain actions."

As we saw from Ben and Jude's lesson last month, God made many covenants.

- Adamic - The promise of redemption
- Noahic - God would never again destroy the world by a flood
- Abrahamic - "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you..."
- Mosaic - This was the Law of the Old Testament
- Davidic - A descendant of David would sit on his throne forever

We see one more covenant within the Old Testament, and we can find it in Jeremiah 31:31-34

## What is the hope offered by the New Covenant?

    "'Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts."
