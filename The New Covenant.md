## What is a Covenant?

    "Generally speaking, a covenant is a promise between two or more parties to perform certain actions."

As we saw from Ben and Jude's lesson last month, God made many covenants.

- Adamic - The promise of redemption
- Noahic - God would never again destroy the world by a flood
- Abrahamic - "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you..."
- Mosaic - This was the Law of the Old Testament
- Davidic - A descendant of David would sit on his throne forever

## Why wasn't the Old Covenant enough?




## What does it mean that Jesus fulfilled the Law?

    "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pas away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." - Matthew 5:17-20

But what does this*mean?*





## Why is the Old Covenant still relevant?

[With one of my old Bible study groups, we had a system called the Four Questions that we would apply to whatever passage we were reading. The questions were

- What does this say about God?
- What does this say about us?
- Is there an attitude we need to change?
- Is there a work we need to do?

When I read this, I can see that there is a work we are to do: We are to teach the Law accurately in its entirety, not skipping over bits that we don't like all that much.

But why?

First, because Jesus said so!

Second, because the Law was put in place by God.]

The Law is from God, written by Moses through the work of the Spirit. Who are we to disagree with God's commands because we think that they're a bit antiquated?



## What is the hope offered by the New Covenant?

We see one more covenant within the Old Testament, and we can find it in Jeremiah 31:31-34

    "'Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts."

## In what way has God "put His laws" in the minds of Christians and "[written] them on their hearts?"
