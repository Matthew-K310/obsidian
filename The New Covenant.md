## What is a Covenant?

    "Generally speaking, a covenant is a promise between two or more parties to perform certain actions."

As we saw from Ben and Jude's lesson last month, God made many covenants.

- Adamic - The promise of redemption
- Noahic - God would never again destroy the world by a flood
- Abrahamic - "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you..."
- Mosaic - This was the Law of the Old Testament
- Davidic - A descendant of David would sit on his throne forever

## Why wasn't the Old Covenant enough?




## Why is the Old Covenant still relevant?

The Old Testament law and covenant is from God, written by Moses, through the work of the Spirit. Are we to disagree with God's commands because we think that they're a bit antiquated?

There are a lot of similarities between the Old and New Testaments.

### First, they both show us how to live.

Throughout the Old Testament, especially the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Bible that make up the Jewish law), we see examples and guidelines (commandments, one might call them) telling us how to conduct ourselves in a way that honors God and brings glory to His name.

### Second, the whole of the Old Testament points to Christ.

The Old Covenant set the groundwork for all that Jesus would do throughout the gospels, and it also gave us a glimpse of the good things to come.

    "For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never"

The greatest example of this is the book of Isaiah.

Twelve different chapters out of the sixty-six in Isaiah contain prophecies of the coming Messiah, and Jude taught last month on the topic of the Promised Messiah. We were in Isaiah 53 during that lesson, which is commonly referred to as the "suffering servant" chapter. There, we see one of the most important prophecies of Christ; that He would suffer and be sacrificed for our sins in order that we might have salvation.

### Third, the Old Testament was the only part of the Bible available at the time of Jesus.

The reason that this is important is that Jesus taught in accordance to the available Scriptures and commonly called back to certain passages and prophecies throughout the Old Testament. 

These reasons, along with the fact that the Old Testament makes up 75 percent of all Scripture, are a testament to the relevance and trustworthy nature of the Old Testament.

## What does it mean that Jesus fulfilled the Law?

    "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pas away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven." - Matthew 5:17-20

But what does this*mean?* Why is it important that He didn't abolish the Law, but fulfilled it?

## What is the hope offered by the New Covenant?

We see one more covenant within the Old Testament, and we can find it in Jeremiah 31:31-34

    "'Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the Lord. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts."

## In what way has God "put His laws" in the minds of Christians and "[written] them on their hearts?"
