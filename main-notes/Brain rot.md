# {{Title}}

The global average screen time is over six and a half hours.

The internet can be used to be productive, but the majority of that time is spent on crap content that doesn't add anything to our lives except mindless stimulation.

It's ok to watch mindless content every now and then, but don't let it replace basic self care.

If we're on track to spend most of our life watching pixels on a screen, shouldn't we be concerned?

We deny our addiction. We want to stop. But we continue scrolling.

Most of the advancements that humans have made throughout history have been done in the name of increased comfort and ease of survival.

Entertainment and stimulation have been the focus of humanity for the past 100 years or so.

    "The world is too stimulating and too comfortable."

We have everything all the time, and we try to numb that overwhelmed feeling with more stimulation.

Most of our stimulation today comes with almost zero effort.

## Why is Mindless Stimulation so Dangerous?

Tiktok happened.

The internet just felt different.

As our access to the internet becomes unrestricted, we start to become hooked and unable to go even a minute without our phones.

Tiktok is objectively the cure for boredom, with you being able to access everything at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

## What Makes Tiktok Different?

The for you page (FYP)

The algorithm learns from your likes, dislikes, and other behaviors. Because of this, it tailors your content to keep you hooked and make your brain release chemicals.

Almost every app has an infinite scroll now.

It becomes this loop of stimulation, that stimulation becoming stale, you become desensitized to it, and then they show more stimulating content.

Our attention spans have become so short that we can barely remember what happened 5 seconds ago.

If your brain thinks that it can be rewarded without effort, it will crave that and become stagnant.

We have become extremely desensitized to content.

We're just there, without a purpose.

    "What's wrong with a little fun? A little longer won't hurt."

Brain rot is an addiction so subtle that we don't even notice that it is an addiction. Or we know its an addiction, and we just make excuses to justify the continuation of this addiction.

## This Addiction Has Become Normalized.

We need focus, but the brain rot has removed that from us.

    "We know its bad, and yet we continue."

    "What is the point?"

Why should our entire being center around stimulation?

How much stimulation do we really need?

We can't even sit without our phones, only thinking, for five minutes.

    "How much free time do I need?"

We want the instant gratification instead of thinking about the long term effects.

Most of the "fun" we have is just staring mindless content on flashing pixels.

It's no longer fun, and yet we swipe one more time.

The vast majority of people choose stimulation over being free.

What happens when we do start creating tailored simulations?

What happens when the virtual world is just as tangible as the real world?
