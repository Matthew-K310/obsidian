## Foundations

- High view of God

  - Exodus 3:14

    There is none like Him. He is holy; set apart from His creation;
    transcendent in power, in glory, and in everything. He is the Creator;
    He is existence itself. All things were made for His glory.

    He is triune; He is just and righteous, yet loving and compassionate.
    His character and glory are reflected fully in Christ, His Son.

- High view of God's Word

  - Psalm 19:7-11

    - The Bible is God's law (precepts, commandments, etc.)
    - It is God's testimony
    - It is the infallible, inerrant Word of God
