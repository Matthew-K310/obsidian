# Thoughts on Scrolling

Do I find it "fun" to mindlessly scroll my day away on social media?

Does it at all help me or make me feel like I'm being productive?

### <u>No</u>

Whenever I mindlessly scroll for hours on end, I feel as if my brain is stuck in a deep bog and can barely move. I can feel my brain turn to mush the more time I spend scrolling and liking and scrolling some more. 

### Why Do I Scroll?

Is it because I enjoy it? Well no, we already covered that. 

Is it because it gives me some new knowledge or bit of wisdom? Not any that is of any use to me in my day to day life. 

So why?

It's because I want to escape my present situation. I feel as if I'm trapped here, and thus need to live vicariously through other people's lives through video. 

In reality, I'm not as trapped as I trick myself into believing. I can go out and walk for hours, so long as I'm back before dark; I can read whatever I want (piracy exists ðŸ˜‰) whenever I want. I don't have a rigid job, which can be good and bad, so I'm not pressed to get something done by a deadline. 

### So what Can I Fill My time with Instead?

- I have a long list of books to be read
- I have programming languages and projects to work on
- I have theological studies to occupy myself with
- I can also play video games
- I can read actually interesting and enriching articles on Substack
- I can make music
- I can make videos

I have an abundance of things that I can fill my time with, but instead I have spent my days mindlessly scrolling through a collection of slop and brain rot for days on end. 

That time is coming to an end.
