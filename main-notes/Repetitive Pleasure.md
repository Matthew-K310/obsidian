> We think of life as a movie that we can rewind and enjoy the same pleasures over again. This is problematic for our everyday lives, as we take pleasure out of its context and thus ruin the action/moment that provided the original pleasure. 


*“Looking at a fine cluster of the bubbles which hung above his head he thought how easy it would be to get up and plunge oneself through the whole lot of them and to feel, all at once, that magical refreshment multiplied tenfold. But he was restrained by the same sort of feeling which had restrained him over-night from tasting a second gourd. He had always disliked the people who encored a favorite air in an opera—“That just spoils it” had been his comment. But this now appeared to him as a principle of far wider application and deeper moment. This itch to have things over again, as if life were a film that could be unrolled twice or even made to work backwards… was it possibly the root of all evil? No: of course the love of money was called that. But money itself—perhaps one valued it chiefly as a defense against chance, a security for being able to have things over again, a means of arresting the unrolling of the film.”*

Repetition of pleasure dulls the enjoyment. See Chapter 12 of “Out of the Silent Planet”.

### Rewinds and Encores

Have you ever experienced something so amazing, so pleasurable, that you want to repeat it over and over again? If so, have you ever done that exact thing to the point where it was no longer enjoyable?

Why do we do this?

Well, as humans we seek out things and people and experiences that bring us enjoyment, entertainment, pleasure, in hopes to live life to the best of our ability (or so they say). We are hard wired to enjoy sex, good food, a good play or movie or book, and that's not a bad thing; what is bad, what leads to a lot of regrets or frustrations in life, is seeking to constantly repeat those actions.

We tend to think of life, as Ransom mused, as some film we can rewind and watch over and over again, but I believe that's problematic. When you see a great scene in a movie, your instinct is to rewind and watch it again; but by doing so, you take it out of its original context and thus ruin the film. 

For plays and operas, it would be rude and quite upsetting to others in the crowd to constantly yell "Encore! Encore!" whenever an amazing moment occurs. 

So why then, if this is the effect of those rewinds and encores, do we want to live life the same way?
