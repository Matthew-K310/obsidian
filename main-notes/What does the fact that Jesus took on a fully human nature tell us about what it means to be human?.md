# What does the fact that Jesus took on a fully human nature tell us about what it means to be human?

$\quad$ "For just as one man is both rational soul and flesh, so too the on Christ is both God and man."

$\quad$ Soul and flesh.

$\quad$ Man is made in the image of God, but what does that mean?

$\quad$ I don't believe that God has a physical form/appearance, but He simply IS.

$\quad$ To be made in the image of God is to have both a soul and a mind; the soul to be filled by the Spirit of God, and a mind to be filled with knowledge of God. - (REFINE)

$\quad$ Christ took on the full nature and appearance of man, having soul and flesh.

$\quad$ He was, for all intents and purposes, as we are.

$\quad$ (I need to research this more, as I want a more conclusive answer; I also want to better understand what is the nature of humanity)
