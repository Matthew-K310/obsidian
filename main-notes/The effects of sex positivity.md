# {{Title}}

   "Some of this (most?), I think, is an unfortunate side effect of all our traditional sexual mores having been discarded in favor of vapid, anything-goes sex positivity with a monomaniacal focus on consent. We barely even have the vocabulary anymore to describe bad or cruel or exexcrable behavior that is *wrong* without being *rape*. Instead, we're left with two categories of sex, consensual and criminal, the unspoken understanding being that you're only allowed to complain about the latter, because heaven forfend you yuck the yum of the guy who gets off on making women crawl around on all fours and drink urine. It should surprise no one that women in this milieu are performing intellectual acrobatics to redefine their terrible-but-consensual sexual experiences as actually rapes; it's the only way anyone will acknowledge that something bad happened to you."
