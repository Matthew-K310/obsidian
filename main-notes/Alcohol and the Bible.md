### Are We Allowed to Consume Alcohol?

In short; yes, but you should be careful. 

The Bible portrays multiple, including Jesus, as drinking alcohol (predominately wine).

Ecclesiastes 9:7-8 say, "Go, eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do." (find context and expand on it)

The Lord does not forbid the drinking of wine or other alcoholic beverages, but we should take caution. 


### Are We Allowed to Get Drunk?

Titus 1:7 - "For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered <u>or a drunkard</u> or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined."

The Lord calls his overseers (pastors, deacons, elders) to live a life that is above reproach. His guidelines include and are not limited to not being drunkards, quick-tempered, or violent. Instead, they should be hospitable, self-controlled, and sober-minded.[^1]

The effects of alcohol can be dangerous to all who drink it, but there is another factor to keep in mind for those of us who are Christians: we can lose control of our actions. 

Say you go to a party, and you have a beer. You feel fine, so you have another and you feel a little buzzed. This is the limit that you should have. Any more drinks, and you could become more suggestible, or be open to things that you would never even think of doing while sober. You could lash out in a drunken rage, you could black out and hook up with some random person at the party, and so on. <u>Never drink to the point of drunkenness</u>

As Christians, our actions should ultimately point towards, and bring glory to, our Lord Jesus Christ. 

When we're under the effects of alcohol, it becomes hard to determine if our actions fulfill this goal or not, as we are not fully in control of our faculties. 

When you get drunk, your mind becomes dulled, which means that Satan has an easier time of influencing us. 

For example, say that you're a happily married man with children. After work, you go to a bar to have a drink or two, but you go a bit too far and get drunk. Now imagine that while you're drunk, an attractive woman starts hitting on you. In your drunken stupor, you forget your family, and end up cheating on your wife with some random woman you met at the bar. 

First off, you didn't have the self-control or discipline to stop before you got drunk. 

Second, your lack of control led to you violating the covenant of marriage by sleeping with someone who is not your spouse. 

Thirdly, you failed to set a good example for your children. As the father, you are to be the spiritual leader of your household and are supposed to set a good example for your wife and kids. 


### Is Alcoholism Idolatry?

Yes. But how is that?

Idolatry is the act of prioritizing something, whether it be a person or object, over the Lord. This could be a literal graven image, or it could be our phones, it could be celebrities, it could be sex, or it could be a substance like drugs or alcohol.

Alcoholism is the act of becoming addicted to alcohol, and continuing to drink it copiously despite the negative effects it has. 

When we become addicted to any substance, we develop a kind of dependence on it, and we feel that we need it more and more often to feel happy. 

You can see how this might distract someone from the Lord, and how they would end up prioritizing it over their own safety. They look forward drinking, they depend on it to feel happy, and so they rely on drinking instead of the all sufficient joy that comes from the Lord. 


### Why Should We Be Careful about Consuming Alcohol?

When we drink, it is visible to others. 

In 1 Corinthians 10, Paul warns against the knowing consumption of meat sacrificed to idols,[^2] saying that it could cause another to stumble. They might see you eat it with the knowledge that it was sacrificed and believe that it is ok to do so, thus sinning in the process. 

I believe this applies to the drinking of alcohol as well. 

When you drink, you are publicly endorsing the consumption of alcohol. Your drinking could cause a fellow brother or sister to stumble and sin. 

They might see you drink, and want to try it for the first time. Say they enjoy their first drink, and then they have a second, and then a third, and then a fourth. Next thing you know, they're black out drunk and a liability to everyone. 

Drunkenness can lead to depression, anxiety, anger issues, violent behavior, drunk driving, or even suicide. 

Don't let that be on your conscience. 

Drink responsibly. Don't get drunk.
