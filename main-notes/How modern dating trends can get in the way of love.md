# {{Title}}

Many phrases or terms like "the ick", and "celibacy era" are used by women under the guise that they are reclaiming sexual autonomy.

    "Often, they are working their way into the collective psyche against the backdrop of a culture obsessed with self care."

The term "the ick" tends to encourage people-usually women- to be more picky or persnickity about their potential partners. Usually, these "ick" are innocuous things like taking naps, swimming strangely, and various other little nitpicks against men's personalities.

    "Going 'boysober' or entering into a 'celibacy era', which involves committing to a (usually) long period of sexual and romantic abstinence, is lauded as a time for personal reflection and self-improvement. Yet by sidelining sexual intimacy altogether, we may be neglecting what is a fundamental aspect of the human experience for most people (though of course not all)."

In the past twenty years, sexual frequency has declined, while anxiety and depression have increased drastically. In addition, many young adults have never experienced a serious romantic relationship. Researchers suggest that the climbing rates of depression and anxiety correlate to this decline in sexual frequency (I quite disagree).

According to a study done by the Kinsey Institute and the dating app Feeld, around half of all Gen Z respondants were single, compared to only around one-fifth of Millennial respondants. This is despite Gen Z being more open and expansive with their views on sexuality and sexual kinks more than prior generations. Even with their expansive views, many report fantasizing about romance and monogamy more than anything else.

    "The gamification of dating apps makes it easy to dump a love interest at the first sign of conflict because it is easy to swipe for a new hook-up."

    "And despite the many good outcomes from the sex positivity movement, there are some anecdotal reports of people feeling left out or like prudes for longing for more traditional relationship structures or not embracing kink."

Because everything is so game-like and easy nowadays, our generation is less equipped to handle anxiety or heartbreak.

    "It's easier than ever to trade in for something else. While we should never settle for unhealthy relationships, these trends could encourage a pattern of avoidance that stifles growth, intimacy, and meaningful connection."

With the uptick in interest in mental health over the past decade or so, therapists have been quicker to label others as toxic, or recommend cutting people off rather than help guide them through conflict resolution.

If we continue these trends, relationships as we know them might cease to exist in the realm of social normality.
