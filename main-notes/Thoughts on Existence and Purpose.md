## If We, as Humans, Were not Created with Intentionality, what is Our Purpose?

- What is the afterlife?
- Why were we created?
- Does humanity even have a purpose?

### Foreword

While I was at work today, my mind began to wander as it is apt to do. In that wandering, I began to ponder the beliefs of atheists, and what they believe our purpose is as humans. 

The paper to follow is a collection of my ramblings and pondering on the topic. 


### Section 1: The Nature of Humanity

I began to think about our nature as humans and, by extension of thought, our purpose (opinions on that to follow in a later section). 

As living, breathing, functioning members of society, we have daily tasks. Wake up, eat, do some sort of job or partake in education, eat again, continue work, come home, eat, and sleep. The cycle continues for days, weeks, years on end throughout our lives. We don't question it, but simply conform to what society believes to be the natural way of life. 

My question arises here; where did we come up with this belief? Were we born with it? Was it something we learned through trial and error? What really dictates how we are to live our lives?


### Section 2: Why Were We Created?

The Greater Westminster Catechism states, "The chief end of man is to glorify God in all that we do, and enjoy Him in it." I see this as the intended way for humans to live (elaborate later, I'm freaking tired).

While this is a wonderful explanation of the chief goal of man, there are many who don't believe in the existence of a divine creator (such as the One True God), and so do not care about this statement of purpose. 

So why were we created?

Well, Charles Darwin's theory of evolution states that we, as humans, were not created but simply evolved from simplistic life forms (apes). While there are many who believe this, I have a simple question:

**If we simply evolved from single-cell organisms that were created by a freak accident in the cosmos, do we really have a purpose for existing**?

If we were simply a galactic mistake, do we even have a reason to go on in living? What is our end goal? What are we to do with ourselves without a divinely inspired purpose?

The answer is simple: nothing.

If we really were created by mistake, and so were created without a purpose, then we have nothing to look forward to after we die. 

### Section 3: What is the Afterlife?

I know there are those who believe that we go somewhere after we die, even if that place is not the heaven that we Christians speak of; but I wonder what the point would even be if there is no divine creator. 

Yes, you can believe in a divine creator but not know who, but for the sake of my sanity I will just be speaking of atheists. 



### Various Random Thoughts

What do we have to look forward to after death?

Is there even anything to hope for?

Our human psyche needs something to latch on to for hope; but if there is no afterlife, what hope do we have?


### Disclaimer

I'm mildly sick, and so these are just my ramblings as of 21:03pm on the night of Thursday, December 19th. 

I'll fix this mess later :p
