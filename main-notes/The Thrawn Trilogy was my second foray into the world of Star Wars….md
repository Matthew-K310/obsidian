Characters

The characters are fun and well written, keeping closely to their movie counterparts. Han is the same sarcastic gambler-turned-Rebel Commander as he was in the movies, but with added depth, especially with the concern he has for Leia while she’s pregnant with her twins.

Chewbacca is still Chewbacca. What else needs to be said. There were many points that showcased him to be the brutal Wookie tribesman he’s always been. In Dark Force Rising, Thrawn’s Star Destroyer; Chimaera, was approaching the Noghri homeworld where he, Leia, and 3P0 were on a diplomatic mission to. He quickly grabbed 3P0, climbed the equivalent of a redwood tree inside of the Maitrach’s court in three bounds, tossed 3P0 in a hiding spot. Then he hit the ground running, and hid with Leia inside of a small room holding himself up between the walls. I have no words to describe how amazed and awestruck I was at the feat.

Lando is still the arrogant (but lovable) smuggler he’s always been and is basically the comic relief of the books.

Leia has grown a lot since the events of the movies. She is now one of most trusted Councillors of the New Republic, commanding the respect of many (minus Fey’Lia, that smug sonuva). She is also developing her skills as a Jedi with Luke’s guidance and has a fun dynamic with her concern for her children.

Skywalker Simp

Let’s take a second to appreciate the absolute legend; Kyle Katar-I mean Luke Skywalker.

Gone is the whiny farm boy that was rescued from Tatooine, and along comes a Jedi Master with a bone to pick with the Imperial Remnant.

Luke has grown in his powers quite a bit, showcased throughout this book and the rest of the series by the way he can sense danger, affect the minds of other, speak to someone across the galaxy, and slice up stormtroopers like a Noghri Assassin Knife through an Imperial. There were so many fun Luke moments that made me stop for a second and read them a few more times (especially some of the fight scenes).

_“Luke shrugged; and, reaching out through the Force, he yanked the blaster out of the trooper's hand._
_The man didn't even pause to gape at the unexpected loss of his weapon. He threw himself forward, hands stretching toward Luke's neck—_
_The blaster, heading straight toward Luke, suddenly reversed direction. The trooper caught the butt end full in the stomach, coughed once in strangled agony, and fell unmoving to the deck.”_

Chiss Ascendancy

Let’s talk about the man, the myth, the Chiss who doesn’t miss; Grand Admiral Thrawn.

I didn’t know what to expect of him, seeing as my only contact with him had been through the Rebels tv show a few years back. I was not at all prepared for the tactical genius, strength of will, and calm demeanor of Thrawn.

These books perfectly showcase his genius, and his ability to learn more about his opponents through their art.

His ability to predict what his opponents will do never ceases to make me simp for him even more, and I left this series with a deep respect for Timothy Zahn for creating one the coolest characters in all of fiction (fight me).

Conclusion

After all that rambling, it’s time to wrap up. The Thrawn Trilogy is an incredible series of books that you will easily want to read again and again. Great characters, fun and engaging combat sequences, and some of the coolest set pieces I’ve seen in a series in recent memory. They don’t overstay their welcome, being concise, while still giving you plenty of incredible scenes and character moments. I would rate them a solid 9.5/10. As always, there will never be a 10/10 series apart from Tolkien’s masterpieces, but I would give them a glowing recommendation to anyone looking for an amazing Sci-Fi series to add to their collection.

The two Rebel Assault Frigates broke to either side of the beleaguered Golan II, delivering massive broadsides as they veered off. A section of the battle station flared and went dark; and against its darkened bulk another wave of Rebel starfighters could be seen slipping past into the shipyards beyond.
And Pellaeon was no longer smiling.
"Don't panic, Captain," Thrawn said. But he, too, was starting to sound grim. "We're not defeated yet. Not by a long shot."
Pellaeon's board pinged. He looked at it— "Sir, we have a priority message coming in from Wayland," he told Thrawn, his stomach twisting with a sudden horrible premonition.
Wayland—the cloning facility—
"Read it, Captain," Thrawn said, his voice deadly quiet.
"Decrypt is coming in now, sir," Pellaeon said, tapping the board impatiently as the message slowly began to come up. It was exactly as he'd feared. "The mountain is under attack, sir," he told Thrawn. "Two different forces of natives, plus some Rebel saboteurs—"
He broke off, frowning in disbelief.
"And a group of Noghri—"
He never got to read any more of the report. Abruptly, a gray-skinned hand slashed out of nowhere, catching him across the throat.
He gagged, falling limply in his chair, his whole body instantly paralyzed.
"For the treachery of the Empire against the Noghri people," Rukh's voice said quietly from beside him as he gasped for breath. "We were betrayed. We have been revenged.” There was a whisper of movement, and he was gone.
Still gasping, struggling against the inertia of his stunned muscles, Pellacon fought to get a hand up to his command board. With one final effort he made it, trying twice before he was able to hit the emergency alert.
And as the wailing of the alarm cut through the noise of a Star Destroyer at battle, he finally managed to turn his head.

Thrawn was sitting upright in his chair, his face strangely calm. In the middle of his chest, a dark red stain was spreading across the spotless white of his Grand Admiral's uniform.
Glittering in the center of the stain was the tip of Rukh's assassin's knife.

Thrawn caught his eye; and to Pellaeon's astonishment, the Grand Admiral smiled. "But," he whispered, "it was so artistically done."

The smile faded.

The glow in his eyes did likewise. and Thrawn, the last Grand Admiral, was gone.

"Captain Pellaeon?" the comm officer called urgently as the medic team arrived—too late—to the Grand Admiral's chair.
"The Nemesis and Stormhawk are requesting orders. What shall I tell them?"
Pellacon looked up at the viewports. At the chaos that had erupted behind the defenses of the supposedly secure ship-yards; at the unexpected need to split his forces to its defense; at the Rebel fleet taking full advantage of the diversion. In the blink of an eye, the universe had suddenly turned against them.
Thrawn could still have pulled an Imperial victory out of it. But he, Pellaeon, was not Thrawn.

"Signal to all ships," he rasped. The words ached in his throat, in a way that ' -d nothing to do with the throbbing pain of Rukh's tree
attack. "Prepare to retreat."

May the Force be with you.
