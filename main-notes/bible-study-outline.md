Our main goal with this study is to grow in knowledge and understanding of God and His Word, in discernment, and in brotherhood with one another.

## "Bible Study Book Club"

Each week, we have a number of chapters assigned to read and study on our own time (no more than 3, but the number will vary depending on chapter length).

On the day of our study, we will come together and discuss what we read and share notes so that we might sharpen one another and learn from the different viewpoints of others.

After the study, you will send in your notes via DM to the assigned collator for that week (if the notes are physical, send pictures (or transfer to digital if you would like to make our job easier)), and that person will the collate and summarize all the notes into a more condensed document for easier reference for
later studies or personal use.

This way, we don't just hear what people learned on that day and then forget it; instead, we will have a growing knowledge base for ourselves, as well as for those who come after us.

The plan for now is to start at the beginning of the New Testament and work our way through it week by week.

This is not a study that we will be able to complete in a few months, or even a few years. We plan to pass this study down to the next generation of youth, on and on for as long as the Lord wills it.

## Scheduling and Communication

### Schedule

During the summer, the study will take place on Wednesdays from 1pm to 3pm.

This is to allow those who have weekend sports or band concerts to be able to attend and join in the study of God's Word.

During the school year, the study will take place on Saturdays from 1pm to 3pm.

We base the start of the school year on when Keller ISD starts back up.

### Communication

We plan to move from using the group chat as our main way of communicating to using Discord. This is to permit more people to join the group, as the group chat is limited to only 20 members because of iOS and Android limitations.

Discord is a very well known chat platform, and I'm sure quite a few of you have used it at some point or another. If enough people are unable to use Discord for various reasons, we will switch to using GroupMe, but that is a last resort.

## Prayer and Accountability

Seeing as we have no Equip during the summer, I think most of us have lost our main source of accountability. Yes, we could keep it up by having a group chat with our accountability group, but it isn't quite the same as sharing in struggles and successes face-to-face.

### Prayer

Within the Discord group, there will be a channel for prayer requests. Each week, someone will take on the responsiblity of collecting the prayers for that week into a Google Doc, and it will be sent to the Discord as a PDF for easy viewing.

### Accountability

These will be our main accountability topics:

- Time in the Word
  - Reading
  - Personal study (not just for the group)
- Prayer
- Purity
  - Purity of speech (cursing, dirty jokes)
  - Sexual purity

## Growth, Leadership, and Responsibilites

### Growth and Leadership

As we move forward with this study, we hope that more and more men will join us. With that growth, we will need a leadership structure in place so that we can stay on track with a larger group.

When we have 10 or more men in attendance, we will split the group up. The size of the group(s) and the number of them will depend on the number of men in attendance.

With these smaller groups comes the need for more leaders to help direct the conversation to stay on track. This is not to say that there will be one person teaching a lesson; instead, it will continue to be a round table style discussion as described previously.

Leaders will be predominately junior and senior guys, with sophomores being chosen to lead only on vote of the upperclassmen. Eventually, we may even have some college students attend as unofficial leaders, but we can call them "the wise guys".

### Responsibilities

Throughout this, you may have noticed that there are some tasks that will need
to be done,

- Collation of notes
- Collection of prayer requests

If you would like to do these, you can volunteer to take on one of these two responsibilities. We would like to have 2-3 people volunteer for each job, so that if someone is sick, on vacation, or otherwise indisposed, we are not without someone to take it on.

For those who want to collate notes, you must NOT USE ChatGPT or any other AI resource to collect and summarize. This is for a few reasons: First, if you take on the responsibility, you should work at it heartily as unto the Lord (Colossians 3:23-24). Second, AI can hallucinate, make errors, and even omit information. If it were to alter the notes or omit an important point, that would not be great.

The same goes for the collection of prayer requests.
