# The Purpose of Our Faith

    "For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ."
    -- Galatians 1:10 (ESV)

What is the reasoning behind our faith?

Who are we trying to please?

Who are we serving?

What is the purpose behind our faith and actions?

    "What is the chief end of man?"
    "The chief end of man is to glorify God in all that we do and enjoy Him forever."
    Westminster Catechism, Statement 1

All that we do is to please God, to serve Him, and to bring glory to His name.
