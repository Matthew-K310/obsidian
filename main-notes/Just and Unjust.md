# Just and Unjust

"My argument against God
was that the universe
seemed so cruel
and unjust --
But how had I
got this idea of
just and unjust?

A man does not call
a line crooked
unless he has some idea
of a straight line.

What was I comparing
this universe with --
when I called it unjust?"

-- C.S. Lewis
