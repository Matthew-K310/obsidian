God spoke and created out of nothing (ex nihilo).

He created light without sun, moon, or stars because He is light. (John 9:5)

"And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it." - Revelation 21:23-24

> Moses wrote Genesis?

"For God, who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." - 2 Corinthians 4:6

"And there was evening and there was morning the first day."

Yom, the Jewish word for day, was used in this passage and is usually referring to a 24-hour period. 

"And it was so." ^f52224

God did not put seeds of trees that would take a long time to grow; instead, He created the world ready and waiting for habitation.

The light He provided was only temporary until He made the sun, moon, and stars; hence why he did not say that "it was so" after the creation of light. [[Class Notes - 1.5.25#^f52224]]

We have yet to understand even half of the full extent of God's creation in the heavens and on earth. ^603943

God did not need the sun and moon to cast light on the earth for He was the one who created them.

Sea creatures and birds were created at the same time (see evolutionary theory of birds and sea creatures).

We only (or don't) know 70-80% of what is in the sea. [[Class Notes - 1.5.25#^603943]]

"Let us make man in <u>our</u> imageâ€¦"

The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are co-equal, co-eternal, and equally all-powerful. They were all present in the garden, and all had equal power in creation. [^1]  ^0f193c

We are like God in that we can reason, and before the Fall we were like Him in that we had no sin.

"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word ws God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made." [[Class Notes - 1.5.25#^0f193c]]

According to evolutionary reasoning that man evolved from animals, who had dominion over the animals for those millions of years?

Where, if we truly evolved, do we get the concept of something being good if we had no truly good God to set the standard?

God did not rest because He was weary; He rested because He was finished.

Christ is the Lord of the Sabbath. (Matthew 12:8)

"Is the Sabbath still in effect?"

Christ is our Sabbath, and we can take our rest in Him and reflect on His gift of salvation.

"The Doctrine of Fine Tuning" - The margins of success for the creation of the universe were so small that it is not possible or probable that the universe was created by a simple accident.

God created with intentionality.
