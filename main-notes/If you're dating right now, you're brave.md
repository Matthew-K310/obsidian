# {{Title}}

People often ask themeselves "Why am I even doing this?" while trying to find/date a long-term partner (poor terminology). 

People feel as if dating is the hardest that it's ever been, with people like it takes too much interpersonal work to support a long-term relationship.

"Modern dating means learning how to be comfortable in with being uncomfortable, standing firmly in your beliefs, and navigating the beliefs of others in very politically divided times…"

"… getting and staying motivated to date even when it feels hard is recognized as an achievement in and of itself."

"Dating People When You Hate People".

Social interactions have suffered since quarantine, with anxiety and depression levels increasing greatly. This has caused regular social interactions to suffer.

This increased social anxiety has made people feel that it is more difficult to meet new people and put themselves out there in a relationship. People are scared that their effort will pay off and they'll meet someone new. (*gasp* putting in the effort to meet someone will result in you meeting someone?!?!)

People are also stressed about finding someone with the same political and religious values as them, which is an increasingly difficult task. 

"They want to find partners who are sympathetic to their political ideologies and minimize their interactions with people with opposing views."

Dating apps have encouraged this type of political segregation (polarization?) within dating. with filters being implemented that let you find someone with a certain political standing.

This brings up the issue of when/how you ask a "partner" about their political views, and how much that is to affect your relationship.

Dating apps are increasingly being seen as a hindrance rather than a help in modern dating culture, with men being afraid to initiate for fear of being seen as creepy or aggressive.

Women are often feeling disappointed in the men with whom they match, stating that they are not engaging enough or not emotionally vulnerable. 

"… dating expectations refer less to a laundry list of must-have qualities and more to basic standards of how they wish to be treated." (I don't believe this)

The sense that women will never meet a partner that can treat them with a basic level of respect is making women contemplate completely opting out of the dating scene (4B movement). Women are worried that they will be unable to find a man who honors his commitments and show up on time, as well as treats them as a gentleman should.

Dating in the modern day requires a lot more effort than previous generations (possibly because you don't know if she has a banana), and so it seems more difficult to sustain a romantic connection with a prospective partner (again with that damned terminology).
