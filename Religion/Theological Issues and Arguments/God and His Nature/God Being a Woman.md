### The Fallacies and Misinterpretation of Scripture

When you look at the above scripture examples, using Isaiah as an example, they liken God to a woman in certain behaviors. 

Isaiah 42:13-15 - "The Lord goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his zeal; he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against his foes. For a long time I have held my peace; I have kept still and restrained myself; now I will cry out like a woman in labor; I will gasp and pant. I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn the rivers into islands, and dry up the pools."

Here, Isaiah likens the Lord's zealous cry to the cry of a woman in labor, with gasping and panting. He is not saying that God is a woman, but instead using allegory to better convey his point.

Isaiah 44:14-16 - "But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me.” “Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you. Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me."

Here, we see Zion in fear that the Lord has forsaken them, that He has forgotten them. 

"Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?" Can the Lord forget His creation, His own chosen people? No. Even a mother may forget her child, but the Lord will never forget. He has engraved Zion on the palms of His hands. 

Again, Isaiah is not saying that the Lord is a mother, but instead uses the example of a mother and her child to say that He will never forget His children. 

---

Isaiah 66:12-13 - "For thus says the Lord: “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall nurse, you shall be carried upon her hip, and bounced upon her knees. As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem."

The Lord will extend his peace to Jerusalem. The Lord will comfort those in Jerusalem like a mother comforts. 

Once more, we see the simile of a mother to symbolize the safety and comfort that God provides.

The most common issues we see in the reasoning of those who argue that God is a woman is a lack of understanding of metaphors or similes like the ones above. Context matters when reading the Scripture; and if you have a lack of context, you begin to misunderstand passages a lot more easily. 


### Conclusion

Context matters when it comes to understanding Scripture. There are many issues in today's church that could be avoid if people had not taken passages out of their context in the wider Bible.
