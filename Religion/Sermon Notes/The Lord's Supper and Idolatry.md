> The Levd'S Supper and Idolatry
> 1 Corinthians
10:14-22
"Now concerning things that were
sacrificed to idols."
Hebrews 12:l
1. The Warning
"Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry."
2. The Confidence
"I speak as to wise men; you judge
what I say,"
Paul was confident that the spirit
would convict those to whom Paul was
speaking
3. The Argument
The idols are nothing, and the sacrifices
are nothing. However, there is still a
supernatural presence in those rituals.
We all partake of the same bread, and
the same cup. The act of consuming
food in the service is usually a
spiritual experience.
There is a similar "spiritual" element
in pagan rituals.
"Look at the nation Israel; are not
those who eat the sacrifices sharers in
the altar"
"You cannot drink the cup of the loved
and the cup of demons; you cannot
partake of the table of the herd and
the table of dement."
Do not be a shaver in the table of
demons. Be mindful of what you
believe and do.
If you have a question as to whether
something is right, go to God's word.
Apply these principles, along with your
personal convictions.
"Should I attend a same-sex wedding?"
I Does it violate your conscience?
_ Does it cause _ encourage a brother or
sister to violate their conscience?
3. Does it violate a principle or command
in scripture?
God ordained marriage, and we are not
to apply our own meaning of marriage.
"Or do we provoke the Loved to jealousy?
We are not stranger than He, are we?"
