7. Be realistic
You will not be able to avoid offending
anyone with your beliefs.
- The Gospel is offensive
- The Gespel offends in its exclusive
claims
The word of the level tends to be
contrary to the beliefs of the would,
and so people see you as a counterculture
outcast.
People wand to believe that there are
others ways to attain salvation, but Jesus
says, "I am THE Way, THE truth, and
THE life; and ne one comes to the Father
except through me. "There is only one wary.
8. De not offend unnecessarily
"Give ne offense either to Jews or to
Greeks or to the church of bod; just
as I also please all men in all things,
not seeking my own profit, but the profit
of the many, se that they may be saved,"
vâ‹…32-33
"I want them to hate the nicest person
they've ever met."- Keith Sanders
