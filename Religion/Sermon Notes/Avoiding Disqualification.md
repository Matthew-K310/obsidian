> Avoiding Disqualification
> (by learning from others)
1 Corinthians 10i1-13
Paul's singular focus was to bring
the gospel to as many people as
possible.
Paul embodies selfless love, as he was
willing to give up his personal comforts
So as to focus on his ministry.
True Christians cannot lose their
faith; but true Christians can make
their reel in the ministry meaningless
by disqualifying themselves by their
actions.
_ Avoid misplaced affections
Do not have idols, do not crave for
worldly pleasures.
Instead, set your eyes on the lord
and his teachings.
2. Avoid inappropriate behavior
The Hebrews became promiscuous and
laid with the people of Moab, and so
disobeyed God's commands for purity.
Materialism and sex.
3. Avoid presuming on Christ
Do not continue in your sin because
you think that you are covered by
your faith.
Do not use your faith as an excuse to
Keep sinning.
"I have faith in the Lord, se I can
do this and he'll forgive me."no!
_ Avoid complaining about the Lord's
provision.
God has given you what you need to
serve him. You just have to recognize it.
"I deserve mere then bed has given
me." No, You have what you need
Te further Christ's kingdom, so be
content and serve Him.
5 Avoid overconfidence.
"I've made it through the hardest
parts of life, and now it's smooth
sailing from here on "
Wrong.
life does not get easier to the point
Where you can coast through your faith.
Complacency in your faith is a dangerous
thing. You begin to neglect parts of
your faith that need strengthening, as
well as letting the strong parts degrade.
6. Trust in God.
Trust in God and not yourself.
Do not blame fat for failing or
giving in to temptation before the
finish line.
