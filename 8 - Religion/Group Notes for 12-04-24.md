Spiritual amnesia - the concept of forgetting what Christ did for us on the cross, and living our life in spite of that. Staying in our sinful habits, and trampling on the sacrifice He made. 

Hebrews 10:26-33

Philippians 1:19-22
James 1:2-4
James 5:9-11
Romans 8:19-33
Revelation 21:3-4

God uses our suffering to draw us closer to Him, but it can also cause a divide if our faith is not strong. 

We are like impure gold, and suffering is the flame. God is purifying us through trials and tribulations, so that we may be a more worthy and resilient Christian. 

Levi - for patience, wisdom, and satisfaction and contentment in You, and for purity in his relationship; and for healing for his baby brother, who broke his collarbone. 

Jude - for patience, peace, and wisdom during finals season; and that You would recenter his sight on you, and show him Your glory in creation. 

Peyton - that You would give him wisdom, and strength, and a desire for You. Give him wisdom in his relationship with Lily. 

Jude HB - for wisdom, strength, and purity. That You would continue to give him this hunger for Your word, and that he would be able to guide others well in it.
