1 - David asks for mercy from the Lord, and he asks for Him to blot out his transgressions. He humbles himself before God and asks for mercy, even though he is a king. Even though he is an earthly king, he still has to answer to THE King. 

2 - He asks to be thoroughly washed from his iniquity, and cleansed of his sins. Without being cleansed of our sins, we cannot be with God. 

God cannot stand sin, and He can’t be around it; and so, we need to be cleansed. 

3 - “For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.” David knows what he’s done, and he sees that every day.

In order to repent and be cleansed, we have to acknowledge our sin; but we don’t like having to admit that we’ve done wrong (pride).

4 - “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight…” When we sin, it’s not against each other, but against God.

Since man is made in His image, when we sin against man, we sin against the likeness of our Creator.

5 - We were conceived in sin, were born into sin, and live our lives in sin. The same truth applies to our parents. 

6 - “Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.” God finds delight when we are truthful with Him. He doesn’t want us to (unsuccessfully) try and hide our sin, but instead to come to Him and repent.

7 - “… wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.” We can only become clean by the power of God. There is no way to become clean apart from him, and our works contribute nothing to our salvation.

8 - “Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.”

9 - “Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.” Again, David wants to be cleansed of his sins, and for them not to be held against him in account.

10 - “Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit in me.” We should aspire to be clean hearted and pure; a good example for the Lord. He is the only way to become clean, and the only One who can restore our spirit to His glory.

11 - David asks that he not be cast away, and that the Holy Spirit might not be taken from him. David is fearful of no longer having a connection to the Lord, as we should all be. 

12 - “Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.” We should find joy and contentment in our salvation. We should be willing to carry out all the Lord commands. David recognized this, and asked that the Lord would center him on that which brings joy.

13 - “Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you.” David would share the gift of salvation with sinners, and guide them back to the Lord.

14 - David asks to be delivered from bloodguilt, as I believe he had already murdered Bathsheba’s husband. He says his tongue will sing aloud of God’s righteousness.

15 - “O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare you praise.”

16 - David recognizes that sacrifices and burn offerings will not please God.

17 - “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite (sorrowful, penitent) heart, O God, you will not despise.” God does not despise a broken and sorrowful heart, as it shows our remorse for having disobeyed Him.

18 - “Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem…”

19 - “… then you will delight in right sacrifices…” Once Jerusalem is built up in the ways of the Lord, He will once again delight in right sacrifices. 

We are to be remorseful when we sin, and are to repent and ask God for His mercy and forgiveness, that me might be cleansed.
