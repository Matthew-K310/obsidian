- What did I do today?
  I read 2 and half chapters of Forges of Mars
  I tried to work on days 1 & 2 of Advent of Code
  I started my zettelkasten
  I got a bit better from my down with the sickness

- What did I learn today?
  That I don't know how to properly code without tutorials
  That I take a lot of notes
  That honey helps with coughs more than cough medicine does
