1859: Reading through messages in Jay's Discord group, and just had a thought.

David (dreamsaremaps) was talking about how he blew up at his mom for mentioning
DOGE, and how it went downhill pretty quick. But then he said something that
kind of got me thinking:

    "All the mindfulness and meditation goes out the window pretty quick still."

If all this meditation is supposed to help you be more in touch with yourself
and be more in control of your emotions, why does it seem to be such a fragile
fix (if that makes sense).

I think it's because that there hasn't truly been any inward change in the
person, and they are taught to just calm themselves outwardly in the moment
instead of addressing the root problem.

But what is the root problem?

They don't know the peace of the Holy Spirit.

The only way that their hearts can truly change from this self-serving,
self-pitying state is to repent of their sins and turn towards God for help and
peace.

Anyway, those are just my rambly thoughts. I might do a full write up on therapy
at some point, if only to learn more about the processes.
