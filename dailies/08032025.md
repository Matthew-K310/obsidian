Had a slip-up this morning. I tried to justify it in some stupid way, and then just felt like crap afterwards.

I need to work on not trying to justify or make excuses or whatever, and to just recognize it for what it is: a sin that will kill me from the inside out.

Anyway, I got a lot of work done on the website.

I added a blurred slideshow on the homepage that links to my featured visuals, fixed fonts on mobile (minus nav font size), fixed font in general, and did a lot of styling tweaks.

I'm quite proud of how it's looking now, and need to use a lot of it as a baseline to continue with Belle's site.

Although, I could start over on her site and make a lot of improvements along the way ðŸ‘€

I don't know.

I like this diary thing; it's kinda fun.

### Idea for Belle's Site!!!

add carousel on home page with hrefs in the images that link to the product pictured

## Ideas for my website

Featured photos button on home page that has a blurred carousel of images.

Not sure what to do with featured videos button.

I need to fix the photos on mobile, as they are extremely broken right now.
