My personal website will be a return to the old web. 
I’ll use it to post pictures and updates (like instagram), and it’ll be a central hub for a lot of cool stuff. 
I need around 10-20gb of storage available on the server, and I would like to have RSS support. 
This way, I don’t have to deal with the shitshow that is modern social media, but I can still allow some people to see what I’ve been up to in my normal life.
