This is day 7 of no porn, and I feel pretty good.

My body feels more awake and alive, my mind is active, and I'm able to think
through problems more easy.

I might be having the first bits of withdrawl, as I feel a bit grumpy, but it
shouldn't last all that long.

I just need to keep my view centered on whats important and not try to justify
looking at something that borders on porn.
