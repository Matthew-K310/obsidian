modify this to run an http server on a vps that is accesible from the domain name belles-crafts.com

---

Raycast AI: Okay, let's look at how to modify and prepare your Go application to run on a VPS and be accessible via `belles-crafts.com`.

The good news is that the Go code itself doesn't need substantial changes _just_ to be accessible via a domain name. The domain name mapping is handled by DNS (Domain Name System) pointing to your VPS's IP address, and then typically a web server (like Nginx or Caddy) or firewall rules on the VPS direct traffic to your Go application's listening port.

Your current code listens on `:8000`, which means it will listen on all available network interfaces on port 8000. This is generally correct for a server running on a VPS, as it will listen on the public IP address as well.

Here's the slightly modified code (mainly adding comments for clarity regarding deployment context) and the crucial steps needed _outside_ of the code on your VPS.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os" // Import os for checking if a file exists (optional but good practice for static server)

	"github.com/Matthew-K310/belles-crafts.git/templates/pages"
)

const (
	// staticFilesDir is the directory containing static assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.)
	// Ensure this path is correct relative to where your compiled binary will run on the VPS.
	staticFilesDir = "./static"
	staticURLPath  = "/static/" // The URL path under which static files are served
)

func main() {
	// Create a new HTTP multiplexer (router)
	mux := http.NewServeMux()

	// Handle home page ("/") requests
	mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Ensure only the exact path "/" is handled here
		if r.URL.Path != "/" {
			http.NotFound(w, r)
			return
		}

		// Set the content type for HTML response
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")

		// Render the HomePage template
		err := pages.HomePage().Render(context.Background(), w)
		if err != nil {
			// Log the error and send a 500 Internal Server Error response
			log.Printf("Error rendering HomePage: %v", err)
			http.Error(w, "Failed to render home page", http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
	})

	// Handle shop page ("/shop") requests
	mux.HandleFunc("/shop", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Ensure only the exact path "/shop" is handled here
		if r.URL.Path != "/shop" {
			http.NotFound(w, r)
			return
		}

		// Set the content type
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")

		// Render the ShopPage template
		err := pages.ShopPage().Render(context.Background(), w)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error rendering ShopPage: %v", err)
			http.Error(w, "Failed to render shop page", http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
	})

	// Handle about page ("/about") requests
	mux.HandleFunc("/about", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Ensure only the exact path "/about" is handled here
		if r.URL.Path != "/about" {
			http.NotFound(w, r)
			return
		}

		// Set the content type
		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")

		// Render the AboutPage template
		err := pages.AboutPage().Render(context.Background(), w)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("Error rendering AboutPage: %v", err)
			http.Error(w, "Failed to render about page", http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
	})

	// --- Static file handling ---
	// Create a handler to serve files from the staticFilesDir directory
	// http.StripPrefix removes the staticURLPath prefix from the request URL
	// before looking for the file in staticFilesDir.
	staticHandler := http.StripPrefix(staticURLPath, http.FileServer(http.Dir(staticFilesDir)))

	// Optional: Check if the static directory exists on startup
	// This helps catch deployment errors early if the directory is missing.
	if _, err := os.Stat(staticFilesDir); os.IsNotExist(err) {
		// Log a fatal error and exit if the directory isn't found
		log.Fatalf("Static files directory not found: %s. Ensure '%s' exists relative to the executable.", staticFilesDir, staticFilesDir)
	} else if err != nil {
        // Handle other potential errors from os.Stat
        log.Fatalf("Error checking static files directory '%s': %v", staticFilesDir, err)
    }

	// Register the static file handler for the staticURLPath
	// Any request path starting with staticURLPath will be handled by staticHandler.
	mux.Handle(staticURLPath, staticHandler)
	// --- End Static file handling ---

	// --- Server Configuration ---
	// Define the port for the server to listen on.
	// ":8000" means listen on all available interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 8000.
	// This is suitable for a VPS where you might use a reverse proxy.
	port := ":8000"
	log.Printf("Server starting on port %s", port)

	// Start the HTTP server
	// http.ListenAndServe listens on the specified port and uses the provided mux as the handler.
	if err := http.ListenAndServe(port, mux); err != nil {
		// Log a fatal error if the server fails to start (e.g., port already in use)
		log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
	}
	// --- End Server Configuration ---
}
```

**Steps Required on Your VPS to make it accessible via `belles-crafts.com`:**

1.  **Compile Your Go Application for the VPS:**

    - Compile your Go code on your local machine targeting the VPS's operating system and architecture. For a typical Linux VPS (like Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian), this would be:
      ```bash
      GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o belles-crafts-server .
      ```
    - Replace `linux` and `amd64` if your VPS has a different OS/architecture (e.g., `arm64`).
    - The `-o belles-crafts-server` flag names the output executable.

2.  **Transfer Files to the VPS:**

    - Use `scp` or another secure file transfer method to copy the compiled `belles-crafts-server` executable and the `static` directory (and possibly the `templates` directory if your rendering requires them at runtime, although your code structure suggests templates might be compiled in) to a directory on your VPS (e.g., `/var/www/belles-crafts/`). Ensure the `static` directory is placed correctly relative to the executable as defined by `staticFilesDir`.

3.  **Configure DNS for `belles-crafts.com`:**

    - Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider's control panel.
    - Create an `A` record that points `belles-crafts.com` (and optionally `www.belles-crafts.com`) to the public IP address of your VPS. DNS changes can take some time to propagate globally (up to a few hours).

4.  **Configure VPS Firewall:**

    - Your VPS likely has a firewall (e.g., `ufw` on Ubuntu, `firewalld` on CentOS).
    - You need to allow incoming traffic on the port your Go application is listening on. Since the Go app listens on `8000`, you'd need to allow traffic on TCP port 8000.
    - **However**, it's highly recommended to use a reverse proxy and expose only standard web ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). See the next step.

5.  **Set up a Reverse Proxy (Recommended - Nginx or Caddy):**

    - Running your Go app directly on port 8000 and exposing that port to the internet works but is not best practice.
    - A reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy offers many benefits:
      - Handles SSL/TLS encryption (serving your site via HTTPS using Let's Encrypt).
      - Listens on standard ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS).
      - Can serve static files (`/static/`) more efficiently than your Go application.
      - Provides features like compression, caching, request buffering, logging, etc.
      - Allows running multiple websites on the same VPS.
    - **Using a Reverse Proxy:**
      - Keep your Go application listening on `localhost:8000` (or `:8000`).
      - Install Nginx or Caddy on the VPS.
      - Configure Nginx/Caddy to listen on ports 80 and 443 for `belles-crafts.com`.
      - Configure Nginx/Caddy to _proxy_ requests for dynamic paths (like `/`, `/shop`, `/about`) to your Go application at `http://localhost:8000`.
      - Configure Nginx/Caddy to serve requests for `/static/` directly from the `staticFilesDir` on the VPS file system.
      - Obtain and configure an SSL certificate (Caddy does this automatically with Let's Encrypt; Nginx requires separate configuration).
      - Configure the VPS firewall to _only_ allow incoming traffic on ports 80 and 443 (and potentially 22 for SSH).

6.  **Run Your Go Application as a Service:**
    - Instead of just running the executable directly, set it up as a background service using `systemd` (common on modern Linux VPS). This ensures your application starts automatically on boot and restarts if it crashes.
    - You'll create a `.service` file in `/etc/systemd/system/` that defines how to start, stop, and manage your Go application.

**Example Conceptual Reverse Proxy Setup (using Nginx):**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name belles-crafts.com www.belles-crafts.com;

    # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (recommended)
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name belles-crafts.com www.belles-crafts.com;

    # --- SSL Configuration ---
    # Point these to your actual SSL certificate files
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/belles-crafts.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/belles-crafts.com/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # Standard SSL options
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # DH params
    # --- End SSL Configuration ---

    # Serve static files directly from Nginx
    location /static/ {
        alias /var/www/belles-crafts/static/; # Path to your static files on the VPS
        expires 1y; # Cache static files in browser for a long time
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }

    # Proxy all other requests to the Go application
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # Forward requests to your Go app
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_redirect off; # Important for redirects within the Go app
    }

    # Optional: Error pages
    error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }

    # Optional: Increase body size limit if needed for uploads
    # client_max_body_size 10M;
}
```

In summary, the Go code listens on an internal port (like 8000) on the VPS. The public access via `belles-crafts.com` is achieved through DNS pointing to the VPS's IP and a reverse proxy (or direct firewall rule) forwarding requests to that internal port. The reverse proxy approach is strongly recommended for production websites.

Matthew Kennedy: what is the best way to host a website with a go backend on a vps?

---

Raycast AI: Okay, the best and most standard way to host a Go web application on a VPS involves a few key components working together:

1.  **Your Go Application:** This listens on a _private_ port (e.g., 8000, 8080, 9000) on the VPS, accessible only locally or within your private network. It handles the dynamic parts of your website (routing requests, interacting with a database if needed, rendering dynamic content).
2.  **A Reverse Proxy Server (Nginx or Caddy):** This listens on the standard public web ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS). It receives incoming requests from the internet, potentially serves static files directly, handles SSL/TLS encryption, and forwards dynamic requests to your Go application running on its private port.
3.  **A Process Manager (systemd):** This ensures your Go application starts automatically when the VPS boots, restarts if it crashes, and runs reliably in the background.
4.  **A Firewall (e.g., `ufw`, `firewalld`):** This protects your VPS by blocking unwanted incoming traffic, allowing only necessary ports (typically 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

Here's why this is the best approach and the steps involved:

**Why Use a Reverse Proxy?**

- **SSL/TLS Termination:** The reverse proxy handles the complex task of managing SSL certificates (like Let's Encrypt for free HTTPS) and encrypting/decrypting traffic. This offloads work from your Go app and centralizes certificate management. Caddy is particularly good at automating Let's Encrypt certificates.
- **Serving Static Files:** Web servers like Nginx and Caddy are highly optimized for serving static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images). They can do this much faster and more efficiently than your Go application, reducing the load on your Go process.
- **Load Balancing:** If you scale to multiple Go instances later, the reverse proxy can distribute traffic among them.
- **Caching:** Reverse proxies can cache responses, further improving performance.
- **Security:** Adds a layer of protection, can filter malicious requests, limit request rates, etc.
- **Standardization:** It's a common pattern, making it easier to find help and integrate with other tools.
- **Running as Non-Root:** Your Go application doesn't need to run with root privileges (which is required to bind to ports 80 or 443 directly). The reverse proxy runs with necessary permissions and forwards requests to your Go app running as a regular user.

**Steps to Implement:**

1.  **Compile Your Go Application:** Compile your Go code on your local machine or a build server for the target architecture of your VPS (usually `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o your-app-name`).
2.  **Transfer Files:** Copy the compiled executable and the `static` directory (and any other necessary assets like templates if they are read at runtime) to a suitable directory on your VPS (e.g., `/var/www/belles-crafts/`).
3.  **Configure Your Go App to Listen Locally:** Ensure your Go application listens on a local interface and a non-privileged port. Your current code `port := ":8000"` which listens on all interfaces on port 8000 is fine, but `port := "127.0.0.1:8000"` would explicitly listen only on the local loopback interface, which is slightly more secure as it's not exposed directly to the public internet even if your firewall is misconfigured. `:8000` is also acceptable if you rely on your firewall to block external access to 8000.
4.  **Install and Configure a Reverse Proxy (Nginx or Caddy):**

    - **Nginx:**
      - Install Nginx (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx` on Debian/Ubuntu).
      - Create a new Nginx configuration file for your site (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/belles-crafts.conf`).
      - Configure Nginx to listen on ports 80 and 443, serve files from your static directory, and proxy dynamic requests to your Go app (e.g., `proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;`).
      - Enable the configuration (`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/belles-crafts.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`).
      - Obtain an SSL certificate (e.g., using Certbot `sudo certbot --nginx -d belles-crafts.com -d www.belles-crafts.com`).
      - Test Nginx config (`sudo nginx -t`) and reload (`sudo systemctl reload nginx`).
    - **Caddy:**

      - Install Caddy (follow instructions at caddyserver.com for your OS). Caddy is often simpler as it automates HTTPS.
      - Create a `Caddyfile` configuration.
      - Configure Caddy to listen on your domain name(s), serve static files, and reverse proxy to your Go app. Caddy automatically gets and renews Let's Encrypt certificates.
      - Example `Caddyfile`:

        ```caddy
        belles-crafts.com, www.belles-crafts.com {
            # Serve static files directly
            handle /static/* {
                root * /var/www/belles-crafts
                file_server
            }

            # Proxy all other requests to the Go app
            handle {
                reverse_proxy localhost:8000
            }

            # Optional: Enable gzip compression
            # encode gzip

            # Optional: Log requests
            # log
        }
        ```

      - Start Caddy (`sudo systemctl enable caddy && sudo systemctl start caddy`).

5.  **Set up `systemd` Service:**

    - Create a service file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/belles-crafts.service`).
    - Define how to start your Go application, specify its working directory, user, etc.
    - Example `belles-crafts.service`:

      ```ini
      [Unit]
      Description=Belle's Crafts Go Web Server
      After=network.target

      [Service]
      User=your_vps_username # Or a dedicated user like 'belle'
      Group=your_vps_username # Or a dedicated group
      WorkingDirectory=/var/www/belles-crafts/
      ExecStart=/var/www/belles-crafts/belles-crafts-server
      Restart=always
      RestartSec=3
      StandardOutput=syslog
      StandardError=syslog
      SyslogIdentifier=belles-crafts-server

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

    - Reload systemd (`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`).
    - Enable and start your service (`sudo systemctl enable belles-crafts && sudo systemctl start belles-crafts`).
    - Check its status and logs (`sudo systemctl status belles-crafts`, `sudo journalctl -u belles-crafts`).

6.  **Configure Firewall:**
    - Allow incoming traffic on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).
    - Deny all other incoming traffic.
    - Example using `ufw`:
      ```bash
      sudo ufw allow ssh
      sudo ufw allow http
      sudo ufw allow https
      sudo ufw enable
      ```
7.  **Update DNS:** Ensure your domain's `A` records (for `belles-crafts.com` and `www.belles-crafts.com`) point to your VPS's public IP address.

This setup provides a robust, secure, and performant foundation for hosting your Go web application on a VPS. The reverse proxy handles the public-facing aspects, the Go app focuses on business logic, and systemd ensures reliability.

Matthew Kennedy: how do i deploy a website that uses templ and htmx and is hosted on a go http server?

---

Raycast AI: Okay, deploying a website built with Go, Templ, and HTMX on a VPS follows the same best practices for deploying any Go web application, with a specific consideration for how Templ templates are handled and how HTMX (as a client-side library) is served.

The key idea remains:

1.  Your Go application runs on a private port on the VPS.
2.  A reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) sits in front, handles public traffic (ports 80/443), SSL (HTTPS), and directs requests to your Go application.
3.  A process manager (like `systemd`) keeps your Go application running reliably.
4.  A firewall secures your VPS.
5.  DNS points your domain to the VPS IP.

Here's how Templ and HTMX fit into this:

- **Templ:** Templ templates (`.templ` files) are _compiled_ into Go code (`.go` files) _before_ you build your final executable. The compiled Go code is then part of your main application binary. You _do not_ need to deploy the original `.templ` files to the VPS.
- **HTMX:** HTMX is a JavaScript library that runs in the user's browser. You need to serve the `htmx.min.js` file (and any CSS, images, or other client-side assets) as static files. These static files should be placed in a designated directory (like `./static`) that your Go application or, preferably, your reverse proxy is configured to serve.

**Deployment Steps:**

1.  **Build Your Go Application (Locally or on a Build Server):**

    - Ensure you have run `templ generate` to compile your `.templ` files into `.go` files. These generated files should be part of your Go module.
    - Compile your Go application for the target operating system and architecture of your VPS (typically Linux AMD64).
      ```bash
      # Make sure you are in the root of your Go project
      templ generate # Ensure templates are compiled
      GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o belles-crafts-server .
      ```
    - This command creates a single executable file named `belles-crafts-server` (or whatever you name it with `-o`). This executable _contains_ all your compiled Go code, including the rendering logic generated by Templ.
    - Make sure your `static` directory contains all client-side assets, including `htmx.min.js`.

2.  **Transfer Files to the VPS:**

    - Use `scp` or a similar tool to copy the compiled executable (`belles-crafts-server`) and the entire `static` directory to a chosen location on your VPS (e.g., `/var/www/belles-crafts/`).

    ```bash
    scp belles-crafts-server your_vps_user@your_vps_ip:/var/www/belles-crafts/
    scp -r static your_vps_user@your_vps_ip:/var/www/belles-crafts/
    ```

    - Make sure the paths align with what your Go application expects for static files (`staticFilesDir` in your code is `./static`, so the executable should be in `/var/www/belles-crafts/` and the static directory should be `/var/www/belles-crafts/static/`).

3.  **Configure Your Go Application:**

    - Your Go application should be configured to listen on a non-privileged port (like 8000) that is _not_ directly exposed to the public internet. Your current code `port := ":8000"` is suitable for this, as it will listen on all interfaces.
    - Your Go application also needs to include handlers for your Templ-rendered pages (which it already does).
    - It _can_ handle static files (your current code does this with `http.FileServer`), but for production, it's often better to let the reverse proxy handle static files directly for performance. However, keeping the static file handler in your Go app is fine, especially during initial setup.

4.  **Install and Configure a Reverse Proxy (Nginx or Caddy - Recommended):**

    - This is crucial for handling public traffic (HTTP/HTTPS) and SSL certificates. It also provides a performance boost by serving static assets directly.
    - Install your chosen reverse proxy on the VPS.
    - Configure it to:

      - Listen on ports 80 and 443 for your domain (`belles-crafts.com`, `www.belles-crafts.com`).
      - Handle SSL/TLS termination (get and manage certificates, e.g., with Certbot for Nginx or automatically with Caddy).
      - **Crucially:** Serve requests for `/static/*` directly from the `static` directory you copied (`/var/www/belles-crafts/static/`).
      - Proxy all other requests (like `/`, `/shop`, `/about`) to your Go application running on its private port (e.g., `localhost:8000`).

    - **Example Nginx Configuration Snippet (within a `server` block):**

      ```nginx
      server_name belles-crafts.com www.belles-crafts.com;

      # ... SSL configuration here ...

      # Serve static files directly
      location /static/ {
          alias /var/www/belles-crafts/static/; # Path to your static dir on VPS
          expires 1y; # Cache static files aggressively in the browser
          access_log off; # Optional: don't log every static file access
          log_not_found off; # Optional: don't log missing static files
      }

      # Proxy all other requests to the Go application
      location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # Forward to your Go app's port
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; # Tells Go app if it was HTTP/HTTPS
          proxy_redirect off; # Prevents Nginx from rewriting Go app redirects
      }
      ```

    - **Example Caddyfile Snippet:**

      ```caddy
      belles-crafts.com, www.belles-crafts.com {
          # Caddy automatically handles HTTPS for these domains

          # Serve static files directly
          handle /static/* {
              root * /var/www/belles-crafts # Root for file server
              file_server browse # browse is optional, serves directory listings
          }

          # Proxy all other requests to the Go app
          handle {
              reverse_proxy localhost:8000
          }

          # Optional: Enable compression
          # encode gzip
      }
      ```

    - After configuring, test your reverse proxy config and reload/restart the service.

5.  **Set up a Process Manager (systemd):**

    - Create a `systemd` service file (`/etc/systemd/system/belles-crafts.service`) to run your Go application in the background.
    - This file defines how to start, stop, and restart your application. Ensure the `ExecStart` path points to your compiled binary and `WorkingDirectory` points to the directory containing the binary and the `static` folder (`/var/www/belles-crafts/`).
    - Enable and start the service (`sudo systemctl enable belles-crafts && sudo systemctl start belles-crafts`).
    - Check the status and logs (`sudo systemctl status belles-crafts`, `sudo journalctl -u belles-crafts`).

6.  **Configure VPS Firewall:**

    - Ensure your VPS firewall (like `ufw`) is configured to **only** allow incoming traffic on necessary ports:
      - Port 22 (SSH) - For connecting to your VPS.
      - Port 80 (HTTP) - For initial HTTP requests (often redirected to HTTPS by the reverse proxy).
      - Port 443 (HTTPS) - For secure web traffic.
    - **Crucially, block direct access to port 8000** (or whatever port your Go app listens on) from the public internet. Only allow `localhost` or the reverse proxy to access it.

7.  **Update DNS:**
    - Go to your domain registrar or DNS provider.
    - Create or update the `A` records for `belles-crafts.com` and `www.belles-crafts.com` to point to the public IP address of your VPS.

**Summary:**

The deployment pattern is standard for Go web apps. Templ doesn't change the deployment steps, as its output is compiled Go code. HTMX is just a static file that needs to be served, ideally by your reverse proxy for efficiency. The reverse proxy is your public-facing server, handling SSL and routing requests to your private Go application process, managed by `systemd`.

Matthew Kennedy: ommitting the certbot section, modify this file to contain the needed reverse proxy items

Raycast AI: Okay, here is the modified Nginx configuration file, omitting the Certbot specific lines and adding the necessary parts for serving static files and proxying requests to your Go application running on `localhost:8000`.

This configuration sets up two `server` blocks:

1.  The first block listens on port 80 (HTTP) and redirects all traffic to the HTTPS version.
2.  The second block listens on port 443 (HTTPS), handles SSL (with placeholders for your certificate paths), serves files from the `/static/` path directly, and proxies all other requests to your Go application on `localhost:8000`.

```nginx
# This server block handles HTTP traffic and redirects it to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80; # Listen on IPv6 port 80 as well
    server_name belles-crafts.com www.belles-crafts.com; # Your domain names

    # Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

# This server block handles HTTPS traffic
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2; # Listen on port 443 for HTTPS, enable HTTP/2
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2; # Listen on IPv6 port 443

    server_name belles-crafts.com www.belles-crafts.com; # Your domain names

    # --- SSL Configuration ---
    # IMPORTANT: Replace these paths with the actual paths to your SSL certificate and key.
    # If you are using a different method than Certbot to obtain/manage certificates,
    # you will need to configure the ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives here.
    # Example (replace with your actual paths):
    # ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/your_domain.crt;
    # ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/your_domain.key;

    # Add other recommended SSL settings here for security and performance (like protocols, ciphers, HSTS, etc.)
    # Example:
    # ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    # ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    # ... other ssl directives ...
    # --- End SSL Configuration ---


    # Location block to serve static files directly from the static directory
    # This is more efficient than letting the Go application serve them.
    location /static/ {
        alias /var/www/belles-crafts/static/; # Specify the absolute path to your static directory on the VPS
        expires 1y; # Cache static files aggressively in the user's browser
        access_log off; # Optional: Reduces log noise for static files
        log_not_found off; # Optional: Don't log 404 errors for static files
    }

    # Location block to proxy all other requests to the Go application
    # Requests not matching the /static/ location will be forwarded here.
    location / {
        # Proxy requests to your Go application listening on localhost:8000
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;

        # Set important headers to pass information about the original request to the Go app
        proxy_set_header Host $host; # Passes the original Host header (e.g., belles-crafts.com)
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; # Passes the client's real IP address
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; # Passes the chain of proxy IPs
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; # Tells the Go app if the original request was http or https

        # Important: Prevents Nginx from rewriting redirects issued by your Go application
        proxy_redirect off;

        # Optional: Add error page handling if your Go app doesn't handle all errors
        # error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
        # location = /50x.html {
        #     root /usr/share/nginx/html; # Or path to your custom error pages
        # }

        # Optional: Increase client body size limit if you have file uploads (default is 1M)
        # client_max_body_size 10M;
    }

    # Optional: Restrict access to hidden files if any end up in your webroot
    location ~ /\. {
        deny all;
        access_log off;
        log_not_found off;
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1.  **HTTP to HTTPS Redirect:** The first `server` block is simplified to listen on port 80 and unconditionally redirect all requests to the HTTPS version using `return 301 https://$host$request_uri;`.
2.  **HTTPS Listeners:** The second `server` block listens on port 443 with `ssl` and `http2` enabled.
3.  **SSL Configuration:** The Certbot-specific `ssl_*` directives and `include` lines are removed. I've added comments indicating where you need to place your actual SSL certificate and key paths and potentially other desired SSL settings if you are managing certificates manually or via a different method.
4.  **Static Files Location (`location /static/`):** A dedicated `location /static/` block is added. The `alias` directive points Nginx directly to the `/var/www/belles-crafts/static/` directory on your VPS's filesystem. This allows Nginx to serve these files much more efficiently than your Go application. `expires 1y` tells browsers to cache these assets for a year, improving performance on repeat visits.
5.  **Go Application Proxy Location (`location /`):** The main `location /` block (which catches all requests not handled by other `location` blocks like `/static/`) is configured to act as a reverse proxy. `proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;` forwards the incoming request to your Go application running locally on port 8000.
6.  **Proxy Headers:** The `proxy_set_header` directives are essential for passing information about the original client request (like the hostname, IP address, and protocol) to your Go application.
7.  **`proxy_redirect off;`:** This is important. If your Go application issues an HTTP redirect (e.g., from `/oldpath` to `/newpath`), `proxy_redirect off;` prevents Nginx from trying to rewrite the redirect URL based on the proxy settings.
8.  **Removed Unnecessary Directives:** Directives like `root /var/www/belles-crafts;` and `index ...;` from the original image's first server block are removed as they are not applicable when proxying or serving static files via `alias`. The `return 404;` in the original HTTP block is also removed as the goal is redirection.

Remember to replace the placeholder SSL paths with your actual certificate files and configure other SSL settings as needed for your security requirements. Save this configuration (e.g., as `/etc/nginx/sites-available/belles-crafts.conf`), enable it (`sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/belles-crafts.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`), test the Nginx configuration (`sudo nginx -t`), and reload Nginx (`sudo systemctl reload nginx`).
